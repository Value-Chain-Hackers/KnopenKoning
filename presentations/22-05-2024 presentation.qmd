maar je moet eerst op pen en papier neerlegger hoe de tussen stappen moeten werken en wat ze moeten outputten , text, json, csv ? wat moet daar in de colonnen die je moet hebben enz dan kan refinen

## Challenges Faced

- **Significant Challenges**:

<style>
  .reveal .slides section.present {
    font-size: 40%; /* Adjust the percentage based on your preference */
  }
</style>
<p>
    - Data inconsistency across sources.
    - Inability for the A.I to produce a result that the previous visualization tool could correctly prase.
    - Access to good data sources and an example
    - Initial model underperformance, Tokensize is very limited to 9000 characters.
    - Hardware limitations, inability to train faster.
    - Inability to parse data effectively into system
    - AI model training takes significant time
    - AI model "Hallucinates"
    - Chris does his best but he needs to be a data-engineer, ai-engineer, full stack programmer all in one.
      - Creating presentations and formats in PowerPoint always take a very long time.
    - Hard to keep head focused on a project that is very big where learning still needs to happen.
    - "good Path" often changes mid-way due to discovery that it's impossible.
    - Reality of time is different that real time, 6 days turns out to be 3.
    - Significant stress due to "significant difference between what is promised and what is shown"
</p>

  
## Mitigating and moving foward
- **concerns addressed by**:
    - Implementing a data cleansing process
    - Now using a Programmer and Data engineering presenting style, you are looking at it!
    - Juypter Notebook intergration directly into code; 
    - Model overview tester to show differences
    - Chain of Thought model prompting for more accurate results
- **Remaining Concerns**: Adding significant data and parsing and inability to see how that will work, Chris needs to learn. 

## Why Chain of Thoughts all of a sudden.

## Chain of Thought Prompting

```{mermaid}

    A[Process Inputs] --> B[Create Thoughts];
    B --> C[Evaluate Pathways];
    C --> D[Summarize Results];
    D --> E[Formulate Conclusions];
```

```{=html}

  }
</style>
<p>Step 1: Focus on acquiring and organizing all necessary inputs that will inform the subsequent stages of thinking.

Step 2: Develop coherent thoughts that logically follow from the processed inputs.

Step 3: Critically evaluate each pathway to determine its feasibility and relevance.

Step 4: Aggregate and synthesize the results to provide a clear overview of what has been discovered or concluded so far.

Step 5: Make informed decisions or conclusions that are supported by the summarized findings and ready to be implemented or communicated.</p>
```


## Product Demonstration

- **Live Demo**: Showcasing the Chain of Thought one
- **Feature Explanation**: Detailed overview of data inputs and machine learning outputs.
- **Interaction Scenarios**: Taking a Present Data Supplychain set and mapping this out, to determine the relationship between them.
-- **Question that is posed**: Between the characters of the "Miserables" what is the connection? 
-- **Features shown**


## Language Model Integration:

The notebook integrates two language models, Ollama with enhanced context capabilities and OpenAIChat from OpenAI's GPT models, to process text inputs.

### Data Processing and Visualization:

A function, load_graph, loads data from a JSON file and converts it into a Mermaid graph format for visualization within the notebook.

## Chain of Thoughts Processing:

Implements a structured data processing approach that sequentially processes data through stages: input processing, thought creation, pathway evaluation, and conclusion formulation, using custom templates for each stage.

### Custom Templates for Language Models:

Uses ChatPromptTemplate and PromptTemplate to define structured prompts that guide the language models' responses, ensuring that each step of the process is contextually relevant to the previous outputs.

### Dynamic Content Rendering:

Outputs from language model processing are rendered as Markdown, allowing for dynamic presentation of both textual and graphical data in the notebook environment.
Iterative and Conditional Processing:

The notebook demonstrates the ability to loop over data iteratively and conditionally based on the outputs from each stage of the processing chain, refining the results with each iteration.

## Synthesis of Complex Data:

It synthesizes complex data from multiple processing steps into a coherent plan or conclusion, demonstrating advanced data handling and decision-making capabilities.

### Interactive Markdown Display:

Markdown is used extensively to display both code-generated graphics and language model outputs interactively, enhancing the readability and user engagement with the notebook content.
