# VHC sprint 

## Welcome & Introduction

- Date: 30-5-2024
- Last Demo: 22 - 5 - 2024
- Presenter: Chris Verhoef
- Objective: Review the progress of our AI Supply Chain Tool development, Plan next iteration. 

## Last Time
- [x] Real-time data processing pipeline.
- [x] Real-time Systhesys of a company data map. That was in Markdown
- [x] User interface for data manipulation and adjustment.
- [x] Intergration into workbook with nice interface allows non-tech users to join the project.
- [x] Model overview Intergration allows us to watch A.I "think" in real time. 
- [x] Optimize the back-end processes to ensure that the visualization is generated within the 20-minute timeframe.
- [x] Complete the development of the initial visualization tool capable of representing power dynamics based solely on a company name.

## PLanned tasks
## Feedback and plan last time:
- **Objectives**:
- Make sure the AI iterates over every part of the supplchain, nultitier Suppliers, 2,3,4-de 5de niveau toega. 
- Training the AI model to be specific; Unilever - ASML - 1ste lijns, tweede lijns. Derde Lijns.
- Add to the Product Limitation; (a razos blade of Philps) A Specific Product; 
- We want to see an improvement of the meeting; Can I see the an Improvement of the mapping.  
- Go back to the Graphical Display to map out the Supplychain 
**Planned Tasks**:
- Collect more diverse data sets
 

## Sprint Overview 

- **Sprint Goals**: Visualize Power Dynamics Ecosystem: For the upcoming demo, develop a feature to visualize the entire ecosystem based on a company name within 20 minutes. 

- [ ] Make sure the AI iterates over every part of the supplchain, nultitier Suppliers, 2,3,4-de 5de niveau toega. 
- [x] Training the AI model to be specific; Unilever - ASML - 1ste lijns, tweede lijns. Derde Lijns.
- [ ] Add to the Product Limitation; (a razos blade of Philps) A Specific Product; 
- [x] We want to see an improvement of the meeting; Can I see the an Improvement of the mapping. 
- [x] Go back to the Graphical Display to map out the Supplychain
- [x] Making a more visual plan of the objective. 
**Planned Tasks**:
    
- [x] Collect more diverse data sets


## Work Completed

::: incremental

- [x] Visual Design, back to the core of the mapping
- [x] Multipule A.I system intergrated
- [x] Now a Unified system with an graphical interface, A.I completly hidden
- [x] A.I now uses more advanced models, though the most advanced are still out of scope
- [x] Design and implement a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input a company name and initiate the visualization process.
- [x] Ensure the interface is intuitive and guides the user through the visualization generation.
- [x] Crawler version one online
- [x] A Data Cleansing process!!
- [x] A data transformation process!!
 
## Challanges Mitigated!

<style>
  .reveal .slides section.present {
    font-size: 100%; /* Adjust the percentage based on your preference */
  }
</style>
<p>

- Inability for the A.I to produce a result that the previous visualization tool could correctly prase.
(Implementing a data cleansing process: DONE!)
- Initial model underperformance, Tokensize is very limited to 9000 characters. 
- Hardware limitations, inability to train faster.
- Inability to parse data effectively into system
- AI model training takes significant time
- Chris does his best but he needs to be a data-engineer, ai-engineer, full stack programmer all in one.
- Creating presentations and formats in PowerPoint always take a very long time.
- Hard to keep head focused on a project that is very big where learning still needs to happen.
- "good Path" often changes mid-way due to discovery that it's impossible.
- Reality of time is different that real time, 6 days turns out to be 3.
</p>


## Challenges Faced, still a problem. 

- **Significant Challenges**:

<style>
  .reveal .slides section.present {
    font-size: 80%; /* Adjust the percentage based on your preference */
  }
</style>
<p>
- Data inconsistency across sources.
- Inability for the A.I to produce a result that the previous visualization tool could correctly prase.
- Access to good data sources and an example
- AI model "Hallucinates"
- "good Path" often changes mid-way due to discovery that it's impossible.
- Significant stress due to "significant difference between what is promised and what is shown.
New: Ayoub had a long ontsteking, is er 2.5 week uit geweest;
New: Nikita kon niet goed genoeg A.I coderen.

## Why Chain of Thoughts all of a sudden.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Chain of Thoughts</th>
<th>Single LLM</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Complexity and Detail</strong></td>
<td>Breaks down complexities into manageable insights, capturing detailed interdependencies.</td>
<td>May overlook nuanced details due to generalized training data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Adaptability and Flexibility</strong></td>
<td>Allows iterative reassessment and refinements, crucial for dynamic environments.</td>
<td>Constrained by initial training, less adaptive to new scenarios.</td>

<td><strong>Risk Identification and Mitigation</strong></td>
<td>Enables comprehensive risk analysis from multiple perspectives and scenarios.</td>
<td>Potentially misses emerging or non-obvious risks, limited by training scope.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Customization and Specificity</strong></td>
<td>Tailored analysis specific to operational needs and strategic goals.</td>
<td>Generalizes based on broad datasets, may neglect organization-specific needs.</td>

## Feedback & Questions

- **Questions Received**:
   
- **Feedback Incorporation**:
    


Heel Gefaseerd maken;
- Wat wij hebben wel toegang wil
wat je eerste instantie op de website

Bedrijven > Product > Lens. 
In de toekomst willen we meer producten toevoegen.

En die chat is heel belangrijk, dat geeft juist de dynamiek, maar niet voor de eerste fase.
Wel voor de mensen die werken aan het project voor de achterankt.
