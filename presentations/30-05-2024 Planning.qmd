# VHC sprint 

## Welcome & Introduction

- Date: 30-5-2024
- Last Demo: 22 - 5 - 2024
- Presenter: Chris Verhoef
- Objective: Review the progress of our AI Supply Chain Tool development, Plan next iteration. 

## Last Time
- [x] Real-time data processing pipeline.
- [x] Real-time Systhesys of a company data map. That was in Markdown
- [x] User interface for data manipulation and adjustment.
- [x] Intergration into workbook with nice interface allows non-tech users to join the project.
- [x] Model overview Intergration allows us to watch A.I "think" in real time. 
- [x] Optimize the back-end processes to ensure that the visualization is generated within the 20-minute timeframe.
- [x] Complete the development of the initial visualization tool capable of representing power dynamics based solely on a company name.

## PLanned tasks
## Feedback and plan last time:
- **Objectives**:
- Make sure the AI iterates over every part of the supplchain, nultitier Suppliers, 2,3,4-de 5de niveau toega. 
- Training the AI model to be specific; Unilever - ASML - 1ste lijns, tweede lijns. Derde Lijns.
- Add to the Product Limitation; (a razos blade of Philps) A Specific Product; 
- We want to see an improvement of the meeting; Can I see the an Improvement of the mapping.  
- Go back to the Graphical Display to map out the Supplychain 
**Planned Tasks**:
- Collect more diverse data sets
 

## Sprint Overview 

- **Sprint Goals**: Visualize Power Dynamics Ecosystem: For the upcoming demo, develop a feature to visualize the entire ecosystem based on a company name within 20 minutes. 

- [ ] Make sure the AI iterates over every part of the supplchain, nultitier Suppliers, 2,3,4-de 5de niveau toega. 
- [x] Training the AI model to be specific; Unilever - ASML - 1ste lijns, tweede lijns. Derde Lijns.
- [ ] Add to the Product Limitation; (a razos blade of Philps) A Specific Product; 
- [x] We want to see an improvement of the meeting; Can I see the an Improvement of the mapping. 
- [x] Go back to the Graphical Display to map out the Supplychain
- [x] Making a more visual plan of the objective. 
**Planned Tasks**:
    
- [x] Collect more diverse data sets


## Work Completed

::: incremental

- [x] Visual Design, back to the core of the mapping
- [x] Multipule A.I system intergrated
- [x] Now a Unified system with an graphical interface, A.I completly hidden
- [x] A.I now uses more advanced models, though the most advanced are still out of scope
- [x] Design and implement a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input a company name and initiate the visualization process.
- [x] Ensure the interface is intuitive and guides the user through the visualization generation.
- [x] Crawler version one online
- [x] A Data Cleansing process!!
- [x] A data transformation process!!
 
## Challanges Mitigated!

<style>
  .reveal .slides section.present {
    font-size: 100%; /* Adjust the percentage based on your preference */
  }
</style>
<p>

- Inability for the A.I to produce a result that the previous visualization tool could correctly prase.
(Implementing a data cleansing process: DONE!)
- Initial model underperformance, Tokensize is very limited to 9000 characters. 
- Hardware limitations, inability to train faster.
- Inability to parse data effectively into system
- AI model training takes significant time
- Chris does his best but he needs to be a data-engineer, ai-engineer, full stack programmer all in one.
- Creating presentations and formats in PowerPoint always take a very long time.
- Hard to keep head focused on a project that is very big where learning still needs to happen.
- "good Path" often changes mid-way due to discovery that it's impossible.
- Reality of time is different that real time, 6 days turns out to be 3.
</p>


## Challenges Faced, still a problem. 

- **Significant Challenges**:

<style>
  .reveal .slides section.present {
    font-size: 80%; /* Adjust the percentage based on your preference */
  }
</style>
<p>
- Data inconsistency across sources.
- Inability for the A.I to produce a result that the previous visualization tool could correctly prase.
- Access to good data sources and an example
- AI model "Hallucinates"
New: Ayoub had a long ontsteking, is er 2.5 week uit geweest;
New: Nikita kon niet goed genoeg A.I coderen. 
</p>


## Why Chain of Thoughts all of a sudden. 

```{=html}

    table { font-size: 70%; }

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Chain of Thoughts</th>
<th>Single LLM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Complexity and Detail</strong></td>
<td>Breaks down complexities into manageable insights, capturing detailed interdependencies.</td>
<td>May overlook nuanced details due to generalized training data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Adaptability and Flexibility</strong></td>
<td>Allows iterative reassessment and refinements, crucial for dynamic environments.</td>
<td>Constrained by initial training, less adaptive to new scenarios.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Risk Identification and Mitigation</strong></td>
<td>Enables comprehensive risk analysis from multiple perspectives and scenarios.</td>
<td>Potentially misses emerging or non-obvious risks, limited by training scope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Customization and Specificity</strong></td>
<td>Tailored analysis specific to operational needs and strategic goals.</td>
<td>Generalizes based on broad datasets, may neglect organization-specific needs.</td>

## Next Sprint

**Sprint Goal 1**: Visualize Power Dynamics Ecosystem: For the upcoming demo, develop a feature to visualize the entire ecosystem based on a company name within 20 minutes. 

In order to do this: we need to build the ontology first; ontology to describe the supply chanin elements as a schema to help the AI structurize knowledge in a well defined way.

This will help to later help to query the knowledge in a structured way. 
{UNTIL WE HAVE THIS, We cannot Draw the mapping in another way.}

Even if you don't want to see the in between sets, we need to have this in order to map the graphs correct this.

We will have this by the End of Next week!

## Sub-Goals:
- [ ] create a protocol to allow the ai to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualisations.
- [ ] Ask multipule A.I's and Multipule Prompts, to identify the which of the data is correct.
To do reanforcement-learning: data set bouwen, zo that the A.I will always answer the correct information. 
Example: I have 3 models and 3 examples, to have concrete examples; to Label them correctly, so that the error margin will get lower. 40% accurate, 70% accurate > 90% accurate.
- [ ] CREWS need to start working; So that it can start crawling the internet for subquestions: "So it can say: Ah I need more information, go and search the internet".
- [ ] Finetune: protocol to allow the ai to control the UI elements and dynamically render various visualisations
- [ ] Need to build the task scheduler for the A.I Crews - >  so that you can see what tasks are running and what is going on. So you can see it "Build" Data.
- [ ] Visual updates about the crews in the interface, so that we  can see what is running.
- [ ] create an ontology to describe the supply chanin elements as a schema to help the AI structurize knowledge in a well defined way.
- [ ] Load significantly more data into the model to parse
- [ ] Chat system needs to work and update map upon prompt
- [ ] First version of the Application online

## Next Sprint (part 2)

- **Sprint Goal 2**: the Setup of a community: Getting ready to recieve the students, setting up alliances and connections
- [ ] Updating the Contacts sheet, making it into markdown so that everyone can read ORGANISATION
- [ ] Creating a digital environment and bringint it online. INFRASTUCTURE
- [ ] Setup of Linkedin Page, LEGITEMACY
- [ ] Texten voor studenten, onboarding process for students. RECRUITMENT
- [ ] Organisation Starting: Creation of a B.V or Non-Profit? LEGITEMACY
- [ ] Setup Recruitment process for students, CRM. RECRUITMENT
- [ ] Creation of Online content for students to learn, LMS
- [ ] Filing for Public Grants, FUNDING
- [ ] Going to Several Events on behalf of Value Chain Hackers, NETWORKING
- [ ] Setup of Social Media for Value Chain Hackers, OUTREACH
- [ ] Making a website , Getting a domain, INFRASTRUCTURE

## Next Sprint (part 3)

- [ ] Server Setup and config budget for Production. INFRASTUCTURE
- [ ] Setup Scripts
- [ ] Splitting the minds over multipule machines

- **Sprint Goal 1**: Version 0.5 Online!

## Feedback & Questions

- **Questions Received**:
   
- **Feedback Incorporation**:
    


Heel Gefaseerd maken;
- Wat wij hebben wel toegang wil
wat je eerste instantie op de website
3 filters
Bedrijven > Product > Lens. 
In de toekomst willen we meer producten toevoegen.

En die chat is heel belangrijk, dat geeft juist de dynamiek, maar niet voor de eerste fase.
Wel voor de mensen die werken aan het project voor de achterankt.
