      "## Supply chain\n",
      "A supply chain, sometimes expressed as a \"supply-chain\", is a complex logistics system that consists of facilities that convert raw materials into finished products and distribute them to end consumers or end customers. Meanwhile, supply chain management deals with the flow of goods within the supply chain in the most efficient manner.\n",
      "In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Suppliers in a supply chain are often ranked by \"tier\", with first-tier suppliers supplying directly to the client, second-tier suppliers supplying to the first tier, and so on.\n",
      "The phrase \"supply chain\" may have been first published in a 1905 article in The Independent which briefly mentions the difficulty of \"keeping a supply chain with India unbroken\" during the British expedition to Tibet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Supply chain management\n",
      "In commerce, supply chain management (SCM) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management, logistics and marketing channels, through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers. A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the \"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally\". This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.\n",
      "SCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product's flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.\n",
      "Supply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach. Current  research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management, among others. Some suggest that the \"people dimension\" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.\n",

      "## Value-stream mapping\n",
      "Value-stream mapping,  also known as material- and information-flow mapping, is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer. A value stream map is a visual tool that displays all critical steps in a specific process and easily quantifies the time and volume taken at each stage. Value stream maps show the flow of both materials and information as they progress through the process.\n",
      "Whereas a value stream map represents a core business process that adds value to a material product, a value chain diagram shows an overview of all activities within a company. Other business activities may be represented in \"value stream diagrams\" and/or other kinds of diagram that represent business processes that create and use business data.\n",

      "The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is a process reference model originally developed and endorsed by the Supply Chain Council, now a part of ASCM, as the cross-industry, standard diagnostic tool for supply chain management. The SCOR model describes the business activities associated with satisfying a customer's demand, which include plan, source, make, deliver, return, and enable. Use of the model includes analyzing the current state of a company's processes and goals, quantifying operational performance, and comparing company performance to benchmark data. SCOR has developed a set of metrics for supply chain performance, and ASCM members have formed industry groups to collect best practices information that companies can use to elevate their supply chain models.\n",
      "This reference model enables users to address, improve, and communicate supply chain management practices within and between all interested parties in the extended enterprise.\n",
      "SCOR was developed in 1996 by the management consulting firm PRTM, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), and AMR Research, now part of Gartner, and endorsed by the Supply Chain Council, now part of ASCM, as the cross-industry de facto standard strategy, performance management, and process improvement diagnostic tool for supply chain management.\n",

      "A global value chain (GVC) refers to the full range of activities that economic actors engage in to bring a product to market. The global value chain does not only involve production processes, but preproduction (such as design) and postproduction processes (such as marketing and distribution).\n",
      "GVC is similar to Industry Level Value Chain but encompasses operations at the global level. GVC is similar to the concept of a supply chain, but the latter focuses on conveyance of materials and products between locations, often including change of ownership of those materials and products. The existence of a global value chain (i.e. where different stages in the production and consumption of materials and products of value take place in different parts of the world) implies a global supply chain engaged in the movement of those materials and products on a global basis.\n",

      "## Value chain\n",
      "A value chain is a progression of activities that a business or firm performs in order to deliver goods and services of value to an end customer. The concept comes from the field of business management and was first described  by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of [Porter's Value Chain] is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management. How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits.\n",
      "According to the OECD Secretary-General (Gurría 2012), the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises (Gurría 2012).\n"

       "'Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.\\nAlthough environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that the contaminants have an anthropogenic source – that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing, extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as point source (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpoint source pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).\\nMany sources of pollution were unregulated parts of industrialization during the 19th and 20th centuries until the emergence of environmental regulation and pollution policy in the later half of the 20th century. Sites where historically polluting industries released persistent pollutants may have legacy pollution long after the source of the pollution is stopped.  Major forms of pollution include air pollution, water pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, light pollution, and visual pollution.\\nPollution has widespread consequences on human and environmental health, having systematic impact on social and economic systems. In 2019, pollution killed nine million people worldwide (one in six deaths), a number unchanged since 2015. Air pollution accounted for 3⁄4 of these earlier deaths. A 2022 literature review found that levels of anthropogenic chemical pollution have exceeded planetary boundaries and now threaten entire ecosystems around the world. Pollutants frequently have outsized impacts on vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, and   marginalized communities, because polluting industries and toxic waste sites tend to be collocated with populations with less economic and political power. This outsized impact is a core reason for the formation of the environmental justice movement, and continues to be a core element of environmental conflicts, particularly in the Global South.\\nBecause of the impacts of these chemicals, local, country and international policy have increasingly sought to regulate pollutants, resulting in increasing air and water quality standards, alongside regulation of specific waste streams. Regional and national policy is typically supervised by environmental agencies or ministries, while international efforts are coordinated by the UN Environmental Program and other treaty bodies. Pollution mitigation is an important part of all of the Sustainable Development Goals.'"

In the production stage, components and semi-finished parts are produced in manufacturing centres. The components are then put together in an assembly plant. The distribution stage consists of central and regional distribution centres that transport products to end-consumers. Mentzer et al. suggest that at least three entities are required for there to be a \"supply chain\".\\nAt the end of the supply chain, materials and finished products only flow there because of the customer behaviour at the end of the chain; academics Alan Harrison and Janet Godsell argue that \"supply chain processes should be co-ordinated in order to focus on end customer buying behaviour\", and look for \"customer responsiveness\" as an indicator confirming that materials are able to flow \"through a sequence of supply chain processes in order to meet end customer buying behaviour\".\\nMany of the exchanges encountered in the supply chain take place between varied companies that seek to maximize their revenue within their sphere of interest but may have little or no knowledge or interest in the remaining players in the supply chain. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses who cooperate in providing product and service offerings has been called the extended enterprise, and the use of the term \"chain\" and the linear structure it appears to represent have been criticised as \"harder to relate ... to the way supply networks really operate. A chain is actually a complex and dynamic supply and demand network.\\nAs part of their efforts to demonstrate ethical practices, many large companies and global brands are integrating codes of conduct and guidelines into their corporate cultures and management systems. Through these, corporations are making demands on their suppliers (facilities, farms, subcontracted services such as cleaning, canteen, security etc.) and verifying, through social audits, that they are complying with the required standard. A lack of transparency in the supply chain can bar consumers from knowledge of where their purchases originated and facilitate socially irresponsible practices. In 2018, the Loyola University Chicago\\'s Supply and Value Chain Center found in a survey that 53% of supply chain professionals considered ethics to be \"extremely\" important to their organization.\\n\\n\\n== Typologies ==\\nMarshall L. Fisher (1997) asks the question in a key article, \"Which is the right supply chain for your product?\" Fisher, and also Naylor, Naim and Berry (1999), identify two matching characteristics of supply chain strategy: a combination of \"functional\" and \"efficient\", or a combination of \"responsive\" and \"innovative\" (Harrison and Godsell).\\nMentzer et al. distinguish between \"direct supply chains\", \"extended supply chains\", and \"ultimate supply chains\"; in their usage:\\n\\na \"direct\" supply chain involves a company, a supplier and a customer\\nan \"extended\" supply chain includes suppliers of the immediate supplier and customers of the immediate customer\\nan \"ultimate\" supply chain includes all of the organisations involved in the supply of the product or service.\\nIn each case, the flow of information and finances is part of the chain as well as the product or service. Fazel Zarandi et al. add \"buyer-seller relations\" (at each stage), in addition to the flow of information, as the third main component of a supply chain. Mentzer et al. remind readers also that the focus of a supply chain is on the product or service in its end state: they refer to \"the supply chain for candy\" and \"the supply chain for clothing\". Individual supply chain actors may be positioned at different points in different supply chains: a bank, for example, may play a supporting role in certain supply chains, but acts as either the customer or the nearest supplier to the customer in the supply chain for security printing.\\n\\nBrown et al. refer to supply chains as either \"loosely coupled\" or \"tightly coupled\":Cutting-edge companies are swapping their tightly coupled processes for loosely coupled ones, making themselves not only more flexible but also more profitable. These ideas refer to two polar models of collaboration: tightly coupled, or \"hard-wired\", also known as \"linked\", collaboration represents a close relationship between a buyer and supplier within the chain, whereas a loosely-coupled link relates to low interdependency between buyer and seller and therefore greater flexibility. The Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply\\'s professional guidance suggests that the aim of a tightly coupled relationship is to reduce inventory and avoid stock-outs.\\n\\n\\n== Modeling ==\\n There are a variety of supply-chain models, which address both the upstream and downstream elements of supply-chain management (SCM). The SCOR (Supply-Chain Operations Reference) model, developed by a consortium of industry and the non-profit Supply Chain Council (now part of APICS) became the cross-industry de facto standard defining the scope of supply-chain management. SCOR measures total supply-chain performance. It is a process reference model for supply-chain management, extending \"from the supplier\\'s supplier to the customer\\'s customer\". It includes delivery and order fulfillment performance, production flexibility, warranty and returns processing costs, inventory and asset turns, and other factors in evaluating the overall effective performance of a supply chain.\\nA supply chain can often be split into different segments: the earlier stages of a supply chain, such as raw material processing and manufacturing, determine their break-even point by considering production costs relative to market price. The later stages of a supply chain, such as wholesale and retail determine their break-even point by considering transaction costs, relative to market price. Additionally, there are financial costs associated with all the stages of a supply chain model.\\nThe Global Supply Chain Forum has introduced an alternative supply chain model. This framework is built on eight key business processes that are both cross-functional and cross-firm in nature. Each process is managed by a cross-functional team including representatives from logistics, production, purchasing, finance, marketing, and research and development. While each process interfaces with key customers and suppliers, the processes of customer relationship management and supplier relationship management form the critical linkages in the supply chain.\\nThe American Productivity and Quality Center (APQC) Process Classification Framework (PCF) SM is a high-level, industry-neutral enterprise process model that allows organizations to see their business processes from a cross-industry viewpoint. The PCF was developed by APQC and its member organizations as an open standard to facilitate improvement through process management and benchmarking, regardless of industry, size, or geography. The PCF organizes operating and management processes into 12 enterprise-level categories, including process groups, and over 1,000 processes and associated activities.\\nIn the developing country public health setting, John Snow, Inc. has developed the JSI Framework for Integrated Supply Chain Management in Public Health, which draws from commercial sector best practices to solve problems in public health supply chains.\\n\\n\\n== Mapping ==\\nSimilarly, supply chain mapping involves documenting information regarding all participants in an organisation\\'s supply chain and assembling the information as a global map of the organisation\\'s supply network.\\n\\n\\n== Management ==\\n\\nIn the 1980s, the term supply-chain management (SCM) was developed to express the need to integrate the key business processes, from end user through original suppliers. Original suppliers are those that provide products, services, and information that add value for customers and other stakeholders. The basic idea behind SCM is that companies and corporations involve themselves in a supply chain by exchanging information about market demand, distribution capacity and production capabilities. Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, is credited with the term\\'s invention after using it in an interview for the Financial Times in 1982. The term was used earlier by Alizamir et al. in 1981, and Burns and Sivazlian in 1978.\\nIf all relevant information is accessible to any relevant company, every company in the supply chain has the ability to help optimize the entire supply chain rather than to sub-optimize based on local optimization. This will lead to better-planned overall production and distribution, which can cut costs and give a more attractive final product, leading to better sales and better overall results for the companies involved.  This is one form of vertical integration. Yet, it has been shown that the motives for and performance efficacy of vertical integration differ by global region.\\nIncorporating SCM successfully leads to a new kind of competition on the global market, where competition is no longer of the company-versus-company form but rather takes on a supply-chain-versus-supply-chain form.\\n\\nThe primary objective of SCM is to fulfill customer demands through the most efficient use of resources, including distribution capacity, inventory, and labor. In theory, a supply chain seeks to match demand with supply and do so with minimal inventory. Various aspects of optimizing the supply chain include liaising with suppliers to eliminate bottlenecks; sourcing strategically to strike a balance between lowest material cost and transportation, implementing just-in-time techniques to optimize manufacturing flow; maintaining the right mix and location of factories and warehouses to serve customer markets; and using location allocation, vehicle routing analysis, dynamic programming, and traditional logistics optimization to maximize the efficiency of distribution.\\nThe term \"logistics\" applies to activities within one company or organization involving product distribution, whereas \"supply chain\" additionally encompasses manufacturing and procurement, and therefore has a much broader focus as it involves multiple enterprises (including suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers) working together to meet a customer need for a product or service.\\nStarting in the 1990s, several companies chose to outsource the logistics aspect of supply-chain management by partnering with a third-party logistics provider (3PL). Companies also outsource production to contract manufacturers. Technology companies have risen to meet the demand to help manage these complex systems. Cloud-based SCM technologies are at the forefront of next-generation supply chains due to their impact on optimization of time, resources, and inventory visibility. Cloud technologies facilitate work being processed offline from a mobile app which solves the common issue of inventory residing in areas with no online coverage or connectivity.\\n\\n\\n== Performance ==\\nSupply chain managers are under constant scrutiny to secure the best pricing for their resources, which becomes a difficult task when faced with the inherent lack of transparency. Cost benchmarking helps to identify competitive pricing within the industry but benchmarking across a range of supply chain performance factors has been recommended as best practice. The SCOR model contains more than 150 key indicators which measure the performance of supply chain operations: see also Supply chain operations reference#Performance measurements. Debra Hofman has noted that \"measuring supply chain performance is not a new practice. Most companies today measure at least some aspect of their supply chain and understand the need for a more comprehensive measurement program.\" However, the abundance of options for potential performance metrics to use is seen as a challenge for supply chain managers. One approach is to relate multiple measures in a hierarchical structure so that interdependencies and the contribution of multiple indicators to the \"key\" or most significant imetrics can be more easily seen. Hofman suggests that the three key indicators of a well-functioning supply chain are:\\n\\nDemand forecast accuracy: referring to the difference (if any) between forecasted demand and actual demand. The ability of a supply chain to respond to customer demand is the most significant factor and functions as a predictor of successful delivery throughout the chain\\nPerfect order fulfillment: orders which are complete, accurate, on time and in perfect condition\\nSupply chain cost, combining all sourcing, production, distribution and customer service costs.\\nA Cranfield University boardroom survey in 2010 found evidence that many organisations recognised the importance of the supply chain contribution to their business success, with a focus on cost, customer lead-time and customer quality being the primary performance indicators.\\n\\n\\n== Resilience ==\\nSupply chain resilience is \"the capacity of a supply chain to persist, adapt, or transform in the face of change\". For a long time, the interpretation of resilience in the sense of engineering resilience (or robustness) prevailed in supply chain management, leading to the notion of persistence. A popular implementation of this idea is given by measuring the time-to-survive and the time-to-recover of the supply chain, allowing identification of weak points in the system. More recently, the interpretations of resilience in the sense of ecological resilience and social–ecological resilience have led to the notions of adaptation and transformation, respectively. A supply chain is thus interpreted as a social-ecological system which – similar to an ecosystem (e.g. forest) – is able to constantly adapt to external environmental conditions and – through the presence of social actors and their ability to foresight – also to transform itself into a fundamentally new system. This leads to a panarchical interpretation of a supply chain, embedding it into a system of systems, allowing to analyze the interactions of the supply chain with systems that operate at other levels (e.g. society, political economy, planet Earth). For example, these three components of resilience can be identified in relation to the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction, when a ship blocked the canal for several days. Persistence means to \"bounce back\"; in our example it is about removing the ship as quickly as possible to allow \"normal\" operations. Adaptation means to accept that the system has reached a \"new normal\" state and to act accordingly; here, this can be implemented by redirecting ships around the African cape or use alternative modes of transport. Finally, transformation means to question the assumptions of globalization, outsourcing, and linear supply chains and to envision alternatives; in this example this could lead to local and circular supply chains.\\nSupply chain resilience has been identified as an important business issue. The United Kingdom\\'s Confederation of British Industry reported in 2014 that a significant number of businesses had reshored parts of their supply chain to European locations, with many identifying supply chain resilience as \"a key factor in their decision to do so\".\\n\\n\\n== Social responsibility ==\\nIncidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse with more than 1,100 victims have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers (those who supply the main customer directly). They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if the supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully manage social responsibility in supply chains. This incident also highlights the need to improve workers safety standards in organizations. Hoi and Lin (2012) note that corporate social responsibility can influence the enacting of policies that can improve occupational safety and health management in organizations. In fact, international organizations with presence in other nations have a responsibility to ensure that workers are well protected by policies in an organization to avoid safety related incidents.\\n\\n\\n== Food supply chains ==\\n\\nMany agribusinesses and food processors source raw materials from smallholder farmers. This is particularly true in certain sectors, such as coffee, cocoa and sugar. Over the past 20 years, there has been a shift towards more traceable supply chains. Rather than purchasing crops that have passed through several layers of collectors, firms are now sourcing directly from farmers or trusted aggregators. The drivers for this change include concerns about food safety, child labor and environmental sustainability as well as a desire to increase productivity and improve crop quality.\\nIn October 2009, the European Commission issued a Communication concerning \"a better functioning food supply chain in Europe\", addressing the three sectors of the European economy which comprise the food supply chain: agriculture, food processing industries, and the distribution sectors. An earlier interim report on food prices (published in December 2008) had already raised concerns about the food supply chain. Arising out of the two reports, the Commission established a \"European Food Prices Monitoring Tool\", an initiative developed by Eurostat and intended to \"increase transparency in the food supply chain\".\\nIn March 2022 the Commission noted \"the need for EU agriculture and food supply chains to become more resilient and sustainable\".\\n\\n\\n== Regulation ==\\nSupply chain security has become particularly important in recent years. As a result, supply chains are often subject to global and local regulations. In the United States, several major regulations emerged in 2010 that have had a lasting impact on how global supply chains operate. These new regulations include the Importer Security Filing (ISF) and additional provisions of the Certified Cargo Screening Program. EU\\'s draft supply chain law are due diligence requirements to protect human rights and the environment in the supply chain.\\n\\n\\n== Trends affecting supply chains ==\\n\\nWith the increasing globalization and easier access to different kinds of alternative products in today\\'s markets, the contribution of product design to generating demand is more significant than ever. In addition, as supply, and therefore competition, among companies for the limited market demand increases and as pricing and other marketing elements become less distinguishing factors, product design likewise plays a different role by providing attractive features to generate demand. In this context, demand generation is used to define how attractive a product design is in terms of creating demand. In other words, it is the ability of a product\\'s design to generate demand by satisfying customer expectations. But product design affects not only demand generation but also manufacturing processes, cost, quality, and lead time. The product design affects the associated supply chain and its requirements directly, including manufacturing, transportation, quality, quantity, production schedule, material selection, production technologies, production policies, regulations, and laws. Broadly, the success of the supply chain depends on the product design and the capabilities of the supply chain, but the reverse is also true: the success of the product depends on the supply chain that produces it.\\n\\nAccording to an industrial engineering study which looked at a process for Design for Supply Chain (DFSC), since the product design imposes multiple requirements on the supply chain, then once a product design is completed, it drives the structure of the supply chain, limiting the flexibility of engineers to generate and evaluate different (and potentially more cost-effective) supply-chain alternatives. Design for Supply Chain is described asa process that aims to drastically reduce the product life cycle costs ... improve product quality, improve efficiency and improve profitability for all partners in the supply chain.\\nSupply chain consultant Anthony Tarantino has identified a number of best practices affecting the resilience and operation of supply chains, including the formation of multi-disciplinary centres of excellence, hybrid supply chain organizations which optimise the balance between centralisation and de-centralisation, and more extensive use of both structured and unstructured data.\\nBig Data is increasingly being utilized in supply chain management, especially in the strategic purchasing and supply management sector. Effective application of Big Data can improve the performance of supply chain activities through improved decision-making capabilities.\\nWith the increased complexity and b2b activity associated with economic growth, actors often seek to view supply chain collaboration as a part of the value adding activities in a value chain.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nSupply-chain sustainability\\nDigital Supply Chain\\nSoftware supply chain\\nFreight forwarder\\nLogistics\\nSupply chain attack\\n2021 global supply chain crisis\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nSupply Chain and Logistics Terms and Glossary',\n",
       " 'In commerce, supply chain management (SCM) deals with a system of procurement (purchasing raw materials/components), operations management, logistics and marketing channels, through which raw materials can be developed into finished products and delivered to their end customers. A more narrow definition of supply chain management is the \"design, planning, execution, control, and monitoring of supply chain activities with the objective of creating net value, building a competitive infrastructure, leveraging worldwide logistics, synchronising supply with demand and measuring performance globally\". This can include the movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, finished goods, and end to end order fulfilment from the point of origin to the point of consumption. Interconnected, interrelated or interlinked networks, channels and node businesses combine in the provision of products and services required by end customers in a supply chain.\\nSCM is the broad range of activities required to plan, control and execute a product\\'s flow from materials to production to distribution in the most economical way possible. SCM encompasses the integrated planning and execution of processes required to optimize the flow of materials, information and capital in functions that broadly include demand planning, sourcing, production, inventory management and logistics—or storage and transportation.\\nSupply chain management strives for an integrated, multidisciplinary, multimethod approach. Current  research in supply chain management is concerned with topics related to resilience, sustainability, and risk management, among others. Some suggest that the \"people dimension\" of SCM, ethical issues, internal integration, transparency/visibility, and human capital/talent management are topics that have, so far, been underrepresented on the research agenda.\\n\\n\\n== Mission ==\\nSupply chain management, techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC, from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs.\\n\\n\\n== Origin of the term and definitions ==\\nIn 1982, Keith Oliver, a consultant at Booz Allen Hamilton, introduced the term \"supply chain management\" to the public domain in an interview for the Financial Times. In 1983 WirtschaftsWoche in Germany published for the first time the results of an implemented and so called \"Supply Chain Management project\", led by Wolfgang Partsch.\\nIn the mid-1990s, the term \"supply chain management\" gained popularity when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user or final consumer, as well as the associated information flows. Mentzer et al. consider it worthy of note that the final consumer was included within these early definitions.:\\u200a2\\u200a Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage.\\nIn the late 1990s, \"supply chain management\" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity. A supply chain, as opposed to supply chain management, is a set of firms who move materials \"forward\", or a set of organizations, directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain.\\nOther commonly accepted definitions of supply chain management include:\\n\\nThe management of upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among suppliers, company, resellers, and final consumers.\\nThe systematic, strategic coordination of traditional business functions and tactics across all business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole.\\nA customer-focused definition is given by Hines (2004:p76): \"Supply chain strategies require a total systems view of the links in the chain that work together efficiently to create customer satisfaction at the end point of delivery to the consumer. As a consequence, costs must be lowered throughout the chain by driving out unnecessary expenses, movements, and handling. The main focus is turned to efficiency and added value, or the end user\\'s perception of value. Efficiency must be increased, and bottlenecks removed. The measurement of performance focuses on total system efficiency and the equitable monetary reward distribution to those within the supply chain. The supply chain system must be responsive to customer requirements.\"\\nThe integration of key business processes across the supply chain for the purpose of creating value for customers and stakeholders.\\nAccording to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, conversion, and logistics management. It also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which may be suppliers, intermediaries, third-party service providers, or customers. Supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses that cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the Extended Enterprise.\\nMentzer et al. make a further distinction between \"supply chain management\" and a \"supply chain orientation\". The latter term involves a recognition that a business strategy cannot be fulfilled without managing the activities of suppliers and customers upstream and downstream, whereas the former term is used for \"the actual implementation of this orientation\".\\nSupply chain visibility, in its origins, was concerned with knowledge of the location/production stage and expected delivery date of incoming products and materials, so that production could be planned, but the development of the term has enabled it to be used to plan orders using knowledge of potential supplies, and to track post-production processes as far as delivery to customers.\\nSupply chain management software includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes. The overall goal of the software is to improve supply chain performance by monitoring a company\\'s supply chain network from end-to-end (suppliers, transporters, returns, warehouses, retailers, manufacturers, and customers).\\nIn some cases, a supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling or the reverse logistics processes for returning faulty or unwanted products back to producers up the value chain.\\n\\n\\n== Functions ==\\nSupply chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply chain management. Supply chain management is concerned with improving trust and collaboration among supply chain partners, thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement.\\n\\n\\n== Importance ==\\nOrganizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy. In Peter Drucker\\'s (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies.\\nIn recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and information technology have enabled many organizations, such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard, to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities. This inter-organizational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organization. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither \"market\" nor \"hierarchy\" categories. It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply-network structures could have on firms, and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms. Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance.\\nIn the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply chain networks. First, as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and business partnerships, significant success factors were identified, complementing the earlier \"just-in-time\", lean manufacturing, and agile manufacturing practices. Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs (a significant component of transaction costs), have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network.\\nMany researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organizational form, using terms such as \"Keiretsu\", \"Extended Enterprise\", \"Virtual Corporation\", \"Global Production Network\", and \"Next Generation Manufacturing System\". In general, such a structure can be defined as \"a group of semi-independent organizations, each with their capabilities, which collaborate in ever-changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration\".\\nThe importance of supply chain management proved crucial in the 2019-2020 fight against the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic that swept across the world. During the pandemic period, governments in countries which had in place effective domestic supply chain management had enough medical supplies to support their needs and enough to donate their surplus to front-line health workers in other jurisdictions. The devastating COVID-19 crisis in US has turned many sectors of the local economy upside down, including the country\\'s storied logistics industry. Some organizations were able to quickly develop foreign supply chains in order to import much needed medical supplies.\\nSupply chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive.\\nThe security-management system for supply chains is described in ISO/IEC 28000 and ISO/IEC 28001 and related standards published jointly by the ISO and the IEC. Supply Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.\\n\\n\\n== Supply chain resilience ==\\nAn important element of SCM is supply chain resilience, defined as \"the capacity of a supply chain to persist, adapt, or transform in the face of change\". For a long time, the interpretation of resilience in the sense of engineering resilience (= robustness) prevailed in supply chain management, leading to the notion of persistence. A popular implementation of this idea is given by measuring the time-to-survive and the time-to-recover of the supply chain, allowing to identify weak points in the system.\\nMore recently, the interpretations of resilience in the sense of ecological resilience and social–ecological resilience have led to the notions of adaptation and transformation, respectively. A supply chain is thus interpreted as a social-ecological system that – similar to an ecosystem (e.g. forest) – is able to constantly adapt to external environmental conditions and – through the presence of social actors and their ability to foresight – also to transform itself into a fundamentally new system. This leads to a panarchical interpretation of a supply chain, embedding it into a system of systems, allowing to analyze the interactions of the supply chain with systems that operate at other levels (e.g. society, political economy, planet Earth).\\nFor example, these three components of resilience can be discussed for the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction, when a ship blocked the canal for several days. Persistence means to \"bounce back\"; in our example it is about removing the ship as quickly as possible to allow \"normal\" operations. Adaptation means to accept that the system has reached a \"new normal\" state and to act accordingly; here, this can be implemented by redirecting ships around the African cape or use alternative modes of transport. Finally, transformation means to question the assumptions of globalization, outsourcing and linear supply chains and to envision alternatives; in this example this could lead to local and circular supply chains that do not need global transportation routes any longer.\\n\\n\\n== Historical developments ==\\nSix major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply chain management studies: creation, integration, globalization, specialization phases one and two, and SCM 2.0.\\n\\n\\n=== Creation era ===\\nThe term \"supply chain management\" was first coined by Keith Oliver in 1982. However, the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before, in the early 20th century, especially with the creation of the assembly line. The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large-scale changes, re-engineering, downsizing driven by cost reduction programs, and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However, the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book Introduction to Supply Chain Management in 1999 by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols, Jr., which published over 25,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian.\\n\\n\\n=== Integration era ===\\nThis era of supply chain management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in the 1960s and developed through the 1990s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This era has continued to develop into the 21st century with the expansion of Internet-based collaborative systems. This era of supply chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value-added and reducing costs through integration.\\nA supply chain can be classified as a stage 1, 2, or 3 network. In stage 1–type supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) is enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves vertical integration with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco.\\n\\n\\n=== Globalization era ===\\nIt is the third movement of supply chain management development, the globalization era, can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organizations\\' supply chains can be traced back several decades (e.g., in the oil industry), it was not until the late 1980s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business. This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global sourcing.\\n\\n\\n=== Specialization era (phase I): outsourced manufacturing and distribution ===\\nIn the 1990s, companies began to focus on \"core competencies\" and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration, sold off non-core operations, and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements, as the supply chain extended beyond the company walls and management was distributed across specialized supply chain partnerships.\\nThis transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work-in-process visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI).\\nThe specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers, suppliers, and customers that work together to design, manufacture, distribute, market, sell, and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market, region, or channel, resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments, each with its own unique characteristics and demands.\\n\\n\\n=== Specialization era (phase II): supply chain management as a service ===\\nSpecialization within the supply chain began in the 1980s with the inception of transportation brokerages, warehouse management (storage and inventory), and non-asset-based carriers, and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning, collaboration, execution, and performance management.\\nMarket forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers, logistics providers, locations, or customers in their role as components of supply chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply chain infrastructure, from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and workflows that are essential to the management of the network itself.\\nSupply chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done; it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific, best-in-class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself, thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain-specific supply chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply chain specialization is gaining popularity.\\nOutsourced technology hosting for supply chain solutions debuted in the late 1990s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider (ASP) model from roughly 1998 through 2003 to the on-demand model from approximately 2003 through 2006, to the software as a service (SaaS) model currently in focus today.\\n\\n\\n=== Supply chain management 2.0 (SCM 2.0) ===\\n\\nThe term SCM 2.0 has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes, methods, and tools to manage them in a new era of globalization and specialization. One element of this is the growing popularity of supply chain collaboration platforms that connect multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions, enabling them to conduct automated supply chain finance transactions.\\nWeb 2.0 is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity. \\n\\nIncreasing volatility has characterized supply chains since about 2000. Douglass in 2010 referred to an SCM management style known as \"extreme supply chain management\", which:recognizes the need for collective, rather than sequential, risk management and facilitates collaboration on a new scale that is necessary for survival. It challenges companies to be \"perpetually vigilant\".\\n\\n\\n== Business-process integration ==\\n\\nSuccessful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply chain processes. In an example scenario, a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department, responding to customer demand, communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply chain partners can only be fully leveraged through business process integration, e.g., using electronic data interchange.\\nSupply chain business process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems, and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow. However, in many companies, management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply chain processes as stated by Lambert (2004) are:\\n\\nCustomer relationship management\\nCustomer service management\\nDemand management\\nOrder fulfillment\\nManufacturing flow management\\nSupplier relationship management\\nProduct development and commercialization\\nReturns management\\nMuch has been written about demand management. Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which include the following:\\n\\nInternal and external collaboration\\nInitiatives to reduce lead time\\nTighter feedback from customer and market demand\\nCustomer-level forecasting\\nOne could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert, such as:\\n\\nCustomer service management process\\nCustomer relationship management concerns the relationship between an organization and its customers. Customer service is the source of customer information. It also provides the customer with real-time information on scheduling and product availability through interfaces with the company\\'s production and distribution operations. Successful organizations use the following steps to build customer relationships:\\ndetermine mutually satisfying goals for organization and customers\\nestablish and maintain customer rapport\\ninduce positive feelings in the organization and the customers\\nInventory management\\nInventory management is concerned with ensuring the right stock at the right levels, in the right place, at the right time and the right cost. Inventory management entails inventory planning and forecasting: forecasting helps planning inventory.\\nProcurement process\\nStrategic plans are drawn up with suppliers to support the manufacturing flow management process and the development of new products. In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product\\'s design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and quality assurance, many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs. Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.\\nProduct development and commercialization\\nHere, customers and suppliers must be integrated into the product development process in order to reduce the time to market. As product life cycles shorten, the appropriate products must be developed and successfully launched with ever-shorter time schedules in order for firms to remain competitive. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), managers of the product development and commercialization process must:\\ncoordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs;\\nselect materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement; and\\ndevelop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the given combination of product and markets.\\nIntegration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and market share. Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual property issues.\\n\\nManufacturing flow management process\\nThe manufacturing process produces and supplies products to the distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times (cycle time compression), meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. La Londe and Masters found in 1994 research that improved supply chain management and cycle time compression were complementary strategies adopted by forward-looking businesses in the United States. This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.\\nPhysical distribution\\nThis concerns the movement of a finished product or service to customers. In physical distribution, the customer is the final destination of a marketing channel, and the availability of the product or service is a vital part of each channel participant\\'s marketing effort. It is also through the physical distribution process that the time and space of customer service become an integral part of marketing. Thus it links a marketing channel with its customers (i.e., it links manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers).\\nOutsourcing/partnerships\\nThis includes not just the outsourcing of the procurement of materials and components, but also the outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain in which it has a distinctive advantage and outsource everything else. This movement has been particularly evident in logistics, where the provision of transport, storage, and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, managing and controlling this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of central and local involvement: strategic decisions are taken centrally, while the monitoring and control of supplier performance and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners are best managed locally.\\nPerformance measurement\\nExperts found a strong relationship from the largest arcs of supplier and customer integration to market share and profitability. Taking advantage of supplier capabilities and emphasizing a long-term supply chain perspective in customer relationships can both be correlated with a firm\\'s performance. As logistics competency becomes a critical factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, measuring logistics performance becomes increasingly important, because the difference between profitable and unprofitable operations becomes narrower. A.T. Kearney Consultants (1985) noted that firms engaging in comprehensive performance measurement realized improvements in overall productivity. According to experts, internal measures are generally collected and analyzed by the firm, including cost, customer service, productivity, asset measurement, and quality. External performance is measured through customer perception measures and \"best practice\" benchmarking.\\nWarehousing management\\nTo reduce a company\\'s cost and expenses, warehousing management is concerned with storage, reducing manpower cost, dispatching authority with on time delivery, loading and unloading facilities with proper area, inventory management system etc.\\nWorkflow management\\nIntegrating suppliers and customers tightly into a workflow (or business process) and thereby achieving an efficient and effective supply chain is a key goal of workflow management.\\n\\n\\n== Theories ==\\nThere are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present. A few authors, such as Halldorsson et al., Ketchen and Hult (2006), and Lavassani et al. (2009), have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories, which may include the following:\\n\\nResource-based view (RBV)\\nTransaction cost analysis (TCA)\\nKnowledge-based view (KBV)\\nStrategic choice theory (SCT)\\nAgency theory (AT)\\nChannel coordination\\nInstitutional theory (InT)\\nSystems theory (ST)\\nNetwork perspective (NP)\\nMaterials logistics management (MLM)\\nJust-in-time (JIT)\\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP)\\nTheory of constraints (TOC)\\nTotal quality management (TQM)\\nAgile manufacturing\\nTime-based competition (TBC)\\nQuick response manufacturing (QRM)\\nCustomer relationship management (CRM)\\nRequirements chain management  (RCM)\\nDynamic Capabilities Theory\\nDynamic Management Theory\\nAvailable-to-promise  (ATP)\\nSupply Chain Roadmap\\nOptimal Positioning of the Delivery Window (OPDW)\\nHowever, the unit of analysis of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system, such as the firm or the supplier-buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the relational view, which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998).\\n\\n\\n== Organization and governance ==\\nThe management of supply chains involve a number of specific challenges regarding the organization of relationships among the different partners along the value chain. Formal and informal governance mechanisms are central elements in the management of supply chain. Particular combinations of governance mechanisms may impact the relational dynamics within the supply chain. The need for interdisciplinarity in SCM research has been pointed out by academics in the field.\\n\\n\\n== Supply chain centroids ==\\nIn the study of supply chain management, the concept of centroids has become a useful economic consideration. In mathematics and physics, a centroid is the arithmetic mean position of all the points in a plane figure. For supply chain management, a centroid is a location with a high proportion of a country\\'s population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within 500 mi (805 km). In the US, two major supply chain centroids have been defined, one near Dayton, Ohio, and a second near Riverside, California.\\nThe centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within 500 miles of 60% of the US population and manufacturing capacity, as well as 60% of Canada\\'s population. The region includes the interchange between I-70 and I-75, one of the busiest in the nation, with 154,000 vehicles passing through per day, of which 30–35% are trucks hauling goods. In addition, the I-75 corridor is home to the busiest north–south rail route east of the Mississippi River.\\nA supply chain is the network of all the individuals, organizations, resources, activities and technology involved in the creation and sale of a product. A supply chain encompasses everything from the delivery of source materials from the supplier to the manufacturer through to its eventual delivery to the end user. The supply chain segment involved with getting the finished product from the manufacturer to the consumer is known as the distribution channel.\\n\\n\\n=== Wal-Mart strategic sourcing approaches ===\\n\\nIn 2010, Wal-Mart announced a big change in its sourcing strategy. Initially, Wal-Mart relied on intermediaries in the sourcing process. It bought only 20% of its stock directly, but the rest were bought through the intermediaries. Therefore, the company came to realize that the presence of many intermediaries in the product sourcing was actually increasing the costs in the supply chain. To cut these costs, Wal-Mart decided to do away with intermediaries in the supply chain and started direct sourcing of its goods from the suppliers. Eduardo Castro-Wright, the then Vice President of Wal-Mart, set an ambitious goal of buying 80% of all Wal-Mart goods directly from the suppliers.  Walmart started purchasing fruits and vegetables on a global scale, where it interacted directly with the suppliers of these goods. The company later engaged the suppliers of other goods, such as cloth and home electronics appliances, directly and eliminated the importing agents. The purchaser, in this case Wal-Mart, can easily direct the suppliers on how to manufacture certain products so that they can be acceptable to the consumers. Thus, Wal-Mart, through direct sourcing, manages to get the exact product quality as it expects, since it engages the suppliers in the producing of these products, hence quality consistency. Using agents in the sourcing process in most cases lead to inconsistency in the quality of the products, since the agent\\'s source the products from different manufacturers that have varying qualities.\\nWal-Mart managed to source directly 80% profit its stock; this has greatly eliminated the intermediaries and cut down the costs between 5-15%, as markups that are introduced by these middlemen in the supply chain are cut. This saves approximately $4–15 billion. This strategy of direct sourcing not only helped Wal-Mart in reducing the costs in the supply chain but also helped in the improvement of supply chain activities through boosting efficiency throughout the entire process. In other words, direct sourcing reduced the time that takes the company to source and stocks the products in its stock. The presence of the intermediaries elongated the time in the process of procurement, which sometimes led to delays in the supply of the commodities in the stores, thus, customers finding empty shelves. Wal-Mart adopted this strategy of sourcing through centralizing the entire process of procurement and sourcing by setting up four global merchandising points for general goods and clothing. The company instructed all the suppliers to bring their products to these central points that are located in different markets. The procurement team assesses the quality brought by the suppliers, buys the goods, and distributes them to various regional markets. The procurement and sourcing at centralized places helped the company to consolidate the suppliers.\\nThe company has established four centralized points, including an office in Mexico City and Canada. Just a mere piloting test on combining the purchase of fresh apples across the United States, Mexico, and Canada led to the savings of about 10%. As a result, the company intended to increase centralization of its procurement in North America for all its fresh fruits and vegetables. Thus, centralization of the procurement process to various points where the suppliers would be meeting with the procurement team is the latest strategy which the company is implementing, and signs show that this strategy is going to cut costs and also improve the efficiency of the procurement process.\\nStrategic vendor partnerships is another strategy the company is using in the sourcing process. Wal-Mart realized that in order for it to ensure consistency in the quality of the products it offers to the consumers and also maintain a steady supply of goods in its stores at a lower cost, it had to create strategic vendor partnerships with the suppliers. Wal-Mart identified and selected the suppliers who met its demand and at the same time offered it the best prices for the goods. It then made a strategic relationship with these vendors by offering and assuring the long-term and high volume of purchases in exchange for the lowest possible prices. Thus, the company has managed to source its products from same suppliers as bulks, but at lower prices. This enables the company to offer competitive prices for its products in its stores, hence, maintaining a competitive advantage over its competitors whose goods are a more expensive in comparison.\\nAnother sourcing strategy Wal-Mart uses is implementing efficient communication relationships with the vendor networks; this is necessary to improve the material flow. The company has all the contacts with the suppliers whom they communicate regularly and make dates on when the goods would be needed, so that the suppliers get ready to deliver the goods in time. The efficient communication between the company\\'s procurement team and the inventory management team enables the company to source goods and fill its shelves on time, without causing delays and empty shelves.  In other words, the company realized that in ensuring a steady flow of the goods into the store, the suppliers have to be informed early enough, so that they can act accordingly to avoid delays in the delivery of goods.  Thus, efficient communication is another tool which Wal-Mart is using to make the supply chain be more efficient and to cut costs.\\nCross-docking is another strategy that Wal-Mart is using to cut costs in its supply chain. Cross-docking is the process of transferring goods directly from inbound trucks to outbound trucks. When the trucks from the suppliers arrive at the distribution centers, most of the trucks are not offloaded to keep the goods in the distribution centers or warehouses; they are transferred directly to another truck designated to deliver goods to specific retail stores for sale. Cross-docking helps in saving the storage costs. Initially, the company was incurring considerable costs of storing the goods from the suppliers in its warehouses and the distributions centers to await the distribution trucks to the retail stores in various regions.\\n\\n\\n== Tax-efficient supply chain management ==\\nTax-efficient supply chain management is a business model that considers the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management. As the consequence of globalization, cross-national businesses pay different tax rates in different countries. Due to these differences, they may legally optimize their supply chain and increase profits based on tax efficiency.\\n\\n\\n== Sustainability and social responsibility in supply chains ==\\nSupply chain networks are integral to an economy, but their health is dependent on the well-being of the environment and society. Supply chain sustainability is a business issue affecting an organization\\'s supply chain or logistics network, and is frequently quantified by comparison with SECH ratings, which address social, ethical, cultural, and health footprints. These build on the triple bottom line incorporating economic, social, and environmental aspects. The more commonly used ESG terminology represents Environment, Social and Governance. Consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and companies\\' ratings and, along with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), are setting the agenda, and beginning to push for transitions to more sustainable approaches such as organically grown foods, anti-sweatshop labor codes, and locally produced goods that support independent and small businesses. Because supply chains may account for over 75% of a company\\'s carbon footprint, many organizations are exploring ways to reduce this and thus improve their profile.\\nFor example, in July 2009, Wal-Mart announced its intentions to create a global sustainability index that would rate products according to the environmental and social impacts of their manufacturing and distribution. The index is intended to create environmental accountability in Wal-Mart\\'s supply chain and to provide motivation and infrastructure for other retail companies to do the same.\\nIt has been reported that companies are increasingly taking environmental performance into account when selecting suppliers.  A 2011 survey by the Carbon Trust found that 50% of multinationals expect to select their suppliers based upon carbon performance in the future and 29% of suppliers could lose their places on \\'green supply chains\\' if they do not have adequate performance records on carbon.\\nIn addition to environmental concerns, increased globalization within global supply chains challenges human rights and worker exploitation risks within multinational corporations including forced labor and modern slavery. Textiles, agriculture, and manufacturing are some of the industries with significant labor exploitation risks. There are many different methods governments, corporations, and NGOs use to prevent labor exploitation, including corporate social responsibility, export controls, import bans, and monitoring labor standards.\\nThe US Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, contained a supply chain sustainability provision in the form of the Conflict Minerals law. This law requires SEC-regulated companies to conduct third party audits of their supply chains in order to determine whether any tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (together referred to as conflict minerals) is mined or sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and create a report (available to the general public and SEC) detailing the due diligence efforts taken and the results of the audit. The chain of suppliers and vendors to these reporting companies will be expected to provide appropriate supporting information.\\nIncidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse, with more than 1,100 victims, have led to widespread discussions about corporate social responsibility across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers. They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully managing social responsibility in supply chains.\\n\\n\\n== Circular supply chain management ==\\nCircular Supply Chain Management (CSCM) is  \"the configuration and coordination of the organizational functions marketing, sales, R&D, production, logistics, IT, finance, and customer service within and across business units and organizations to close, slow, intensify, narrow, and dematerialise material and energy loops to minimize resource input into and waste and emission leakage out of the system, improve its operative effectiveness and efficiency and generate competitive advantages\". By reducing resource input and waste leakage along the supply chain and configure it to enable the recirculation of resources at different stages of the product or service lifecycle, potential economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. These comprise e.g. a decrease in material and waste management cost and reduced emissions and resource consumption.\\n\\n\\n== Components ==\\n\\n\\n=== Management components ===\\nSCM components are the third element of the four-square circulation framework. The level of integration and management of a business process link is a function of the number and level of components added to the link. Consequently, adding more management components or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link.\\nLiterature on business process reengineering, buyer-supplier relationships, and SCM suggests various possible components that should receive managerial attention when managing supply relationships. Lambert and Cooper (2000) identified the following components:\\n\\nPlanning and control\\nWork structure\\nOrganization structure\\nProduct flow facility structure\\nInformation flow facility structure\\nManagement methods\\nPower and leadership structure\\nRisk and reward structure\\nCulture and attitude\\nHowever, a more careful examination of the existing literature leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what should be the key critical supply chain components, or \"branches\" of the previously identified supply chain business processes—that is, what kind of relationship the components may have that are related to suppliers and customers. Bowersox and Closs (1996) state that the emphasis on cooperation represents the synergism leading to the highest level of joint achievement. A primary-level channel participant is a business that is willing to participate in responsibility for inventory ownership or assume other financial risks, thus including primary level components. A secondary-level participant (specialized) is a business that participates in channel relationships by performing essential services for primary participants, including secondary level components, which support primary participants. Third-level channel participants and components that support primary-level channel participants and are the fundamental branches of secondary-level components may also be included.\\nConsequently, Lambert and Cooper\\'s framework of supply chain components does not lead to any conclusion about what are the primary- or secondary-level (specialized) supply chain components —that is, which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary, how these components should be structured in order to achieve a more comprehensive supply chain structure, and how to examine the supply chain as an integrative one.\\n\\n\\n=== Power in supply chain management ===\\nAndrew Cox, Joe Sanderson and Glyn Watson argue that the power resources of buyers and suppliers should be analyzed in order to understand how a supply chain relationship operates. In some cases, a purchasing firm may exercise more power over its suppliers, in other cases, suppliers may have more power; yet again there will be cases where buyers and suppliers may be interdependent or may have no real power over each other. Cox, Sanderson and Watson have written extensively on the operation of power regimes within a supply chain context; they have described their work for themselves as \"a new perspective on managing in supply chains and networks\". Other studies of power in supply chain relationships have looked at drivers impacting on the potential integration of supply chains. A study by Michael Maloni and W. C. Benton in 1998 looked at whether potential asymmetries in inter-firm power within a supply chain could prevent the implementation of effective supply chain execution. Maloni and Benton note that until their research, \"little power research\" had been presented in the supply chain literature. Using French and Raven\\'s typology of the sources of power in the context of the automotive industry, they aimed to analyse the effects of distinct power strategies on relationships between buyers and sellers, and upon supply chain performance and satisfaction. Their findings showed that:\\n\\nexpert and referent power sources lent themselves to \"significant positive effects\" on supply chain relationships;\\nreward power had a somewhat beneficial impact\\ncoercive and legal/legitimate power bases, which they describe as \"completely mediated power strategies\", led to \"significant negative relationships\".\\nThey concluded that \"prudent use of power\" can be beneficial for both the power source and the power target.\\n\\n\\n=== Reverse supply chain ===\\nReverse logistics is the process of managing the return of goods and may be considered as an aspect of \"aftermarket customer services\". Any time money is taken from a company\\'s warranty reserve or service logistics budget, one can speak of a reverse logistics operation. Reverse logistics also includes the process of managing the return of goods from store, which the returned goods are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise.\\n\\n\\n== Supply Chain Engineering ==\\nAlthough it has the same goals as supply chain engineering, supply chain management is focused on a more traditional management and business based approach, whereas supply chain engineering is focused on a mathematical model based one.\\n\\n\\n== Digitizing supply chains ==\\nConsultancies and media expect the performance efficacy of digitizing supply chains to be high. Additive manufacturing and blockchain technology have emerged as the two technologies with some of the highest economic relevance.\\n\\nAdditive manufacturing\\nThe potential of additive manufacturing is particularly high in the production of spare parts, since its introduction can reduce warehousing costs of slowly rotating spare parts. Digitizing technology bears the potential to completely disrupt and restructure supply chains and enhance existing production routes.\\nBlockchain\\nIn comparison, research on the influence of blockchain technology on the supply chain is still in its early stages. The conceptual literature has argued for a considerably long time that the highest performance efficacy is expected in the potential for automatic contract creation. Empirical evidence contradicts this hypothesis: the highest potential is expected in the arenas of verified customer reviews and certifications of product quality and standards. In addition, traditional supply chain has many drawbacks such as lack of transparency and trust, and some of them can be solved by blockchain technology. The technological features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of information, as well as high levels of reliability and immutability of records. That helps traditional supply chain management to be more efficient and reliable.\\n\\n\\n== Systems and value ==\\nSupply chain systems configure value for those that organize the networks. Value is the additional revenue over and above the costs of building the network. Co-creating value and sharing the benefits appropriately to encourage effective participation is a key challenge for any supply system. Tony Hines defines value as follows: \"Ultimately it is the customer who pays the price for service delivered that confirms value and not the producer who simply adds cost until that point\".\\n\\n\\n== Global applications ==\\nGlobal supply chains pose challenges regarding both quantity and value. Supply and value chain trends include:\\n\\nGlobalization\\nIncreased cross-border sourcing\\nCollaboration for parts of value chain with low-cost providers\\nShared service centers for logistical and administrative functions\\nIncreasingly global operations, which require increasingly global coordination and planning to achieve global optimums\\nComplex problems involve also midsized companies to an increasing degree\\nThese trends have many benefits for manufacturers because they make possible larger lot sizes, lower taxes, and better environments (e.g., culture, infrastructure, special tax zones, or sophisticated OEM) for their products. There are many additional challenges when the scope of supply chains is global. This is because with a supply chain of a larger scope, the lead time is much longer, and because there are more issues involved, such as multiple currencies, policies, and laws. The consequent problems include different currencies and valuations in different countries, different tax laws, different trading protocols, vulnerability to natural disasters and cyber threats, and lack of transparency of cost and profit.\\n\\n\\n== Roles and responsibilities ==\\nSupply chain professionals play major roles in the design and management of supply chains. In the design of supply chains, they help determine whether a product or service is provided by the firm itself (insourcing) or by another firm elsewhere (outsourcing). In the management of supply chains, supply chain professionals coordinate production among multiple providers, ensuring that production and transport of goods happen with minimal quality control or inventory problems. One goal of a well-designed and maintained supply chain for a product is to successfully build the product at minimal cost. Such a supply chain could be considered a competitive advantage for a firm.\\nBeyond design and maintenance of a supply chain itself, supply chain professionals participate in aspects of business that have a bearing on supply chains, such as sales forecasting, quality management, strategy development, customer service, and systems analysis. Production of a good may evolve over time, rendering an existing supply chain design obsolete. Supply chain professionals need to be aware of changes in production and business climate that affect supply chains and create alternative supply chains as the need arises.\\nIn a research project undertaken by Michigan State University\\'s Broad College of Business, with input from 50 participating organizations, the main issues of concern to supply chain managers were identified as capacity/resource availability, talent (recruitment), complexity, threats/challenges (supply chain risks), compliance and cost/purchasing issues. Keeping up with frequent changes in regulation was identified as a particular concern. Complexity within supply chains has also been highlighted in Supply Chain Digest and by Gartner as a perennial challenge.\\nSupply chain consultants may provide expert knowledge in order to assess the productivity of a supply chain and, ideally, to enhance its productivity. Supply chain consulting involves the transfer of knowledge on how to exploit existing assets through improved coordination and can hence be a source of competitive advantage: the role of the consultant is to help management by adding value to the whole process through the various sectors from the ordering of the raw materials to the final product. In this regard, firms may either build internal teams of consultants to tackle the issue or engage external ones: companies choose between these two approaches taking into consideration various factors.\\nThe use of external consultants is a common practice among companies. The whole consulting process generally involves the analysis of the entire supply chain process, including the countermeasures or correctives to take to achieve a better overall performance.\\n\\n\\n== Skills and competencies ==\\nSupply chain professionals need to have knowledge of managing supply chain functions such as transportation, warehousing, inventory management, and production planning. In the past, supply chain professionals emphasized logistics skills, such as knowledge of shipping routes, familiarity with warehousing equipment and distribution center locations and footprints, and a solid grasp of freight rates and fuel costs. More recently, supply chain management extends to logistical support across firms and management of global supply chains. Supply chain professionals need to have an understanding of business continuity basics and strategies, and Tramarico et al noted that several processes from other disciplinary theories, including the resource-based view, supply chain design and interorganizational relationships are integral to a mature understanding of supply chain management. A shortage of skilled supply chain professionals was highlighted in a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published in 2010, which highlighted plentiful supply of staff with \"narrow technical skillsets\" but shortages in the numbers of job applicants with \"broader business skills\".\\n\\n\\n=== Certification ===\\nIndividuals working in supply chain management can attain professional certification by passing an exam developed by a third party certification organization. The purpose of certification is to guarantee a certain level of expertise in the field. The knowledge needed to pass a certification exam may be gained from several sources. Some knowledge may come from college courses, but most of it is acquired from a mix of on-the-job learning experiences, attending industry events, learning best practices with their peers, and reading books and articles in the field. Certification organizations may provide certification workshops tailored to their exams.\\n\\n\\n=== University rankings ===\\nThe following North American universities rank high in their master\\'s education in the SCM World University 100 ranking, which was published in 2017 and which is based on the opinions of supply chain managers: Michigan State University, Penn State University, University of Tennessee, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Arizona State University, University of Texas at Austin and Western Michigan University. In the same ranking, the following European universities rank high: Cranfield School of Management, Vlerick Business School, INSEAD, Cambridge University, Eindhoven University of Technology, London Business School and Copenhagen Business School. \\nThe following universities rank high in the 2016 Eduniversal Best Masters ranking for supply chain and logistics: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, KEDGE Business School, Purdue University, Rotterdam School of Management, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Vienna University of Economics and Business and Copenhagen Business School.\\n\\n\\n=== Organizations ===\\nA number of organizations provide certification in supply chain management, such as the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP), IIPMR (International Institute for Procurement and Market Research), APICS (the Association for Operations Management), ISCEA (International Supply Chain Education Alliance) and IoSCM (Institute of Supply Chain Management). APICS\\' certification is called Certified Supply Chain Professional, or CSCP, and ISCEA\\'s certification is called the Certified Supply Chain Manager (CSCM), CISCM (Chartered Institute of Supply Chain Management) awards certificate as Chartered Supply Chain Management Professional (CSCMP). Another, the Institute for Supply Management, is developing one called the Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) focused on the procurement and sourcing areas of supply chain management. The Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA) is the main certifying body for Canada with the designations having global reciprocity. The designation Supply Chain Management Professional (SCMP) is the title of the supply chain leadership designation.\\n\\n\\n==== Topics addressed by selected professional supply chain certification programmes ====\\n\\nThe following table compares topics addressed by selected professional supply chain certification programmes.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBeer distribution game\\nDemand-chain management\\nMilitary supply chain management\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==',\n",
       " 'Value-stream mapping,  also known as material- and information-flow mapping, is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer. A value stream map is a visual tool that displays all critical steps in a specific process and easily quantifies the time and volume taken at each stage. Value stream maps show the flow of both materials and information as they progress through the process.\\nWhereas a value stream map represents a core business process that adds value to a material product, a value chain diagram shows an overview of all activities within a company. Other business activities may be represented in \"value stream diagrams\" and/or other kinds of diagram that represent business processes that create and use business data.\\n\\n\\n== Purpose ==\\nThe purpose of value-stream mapping is to identify and remove or reduce \"waste\" in value streams, thereby increasing the efficiency of a given value stream. Waste removal is intended to increase productivity by creating leaner operations which in turn make waste and quality problems easier to identify.\\n\\n\\n=== Applications ===\\nValue-stream mapping has supporting methods that are often used in Lean environments to analyze and design flows at the system level (across multiple processes).\\nAlthough value-stream mapping is often associated with manufacturing, it is also used in logistics, supply chain, service related industries, healthcare, software development, product development, project management, and administrative and office processes.\\n\\n\\n== Identifying waste ==\\n\\n\\n=== Types of waste ===\\nDaniel T. Jones (1995) identifies seven commonly accepted types of waste. These terms are updated from Toyota\\'s operating model \"The Toyota Way\" (Toyota Production System, TPS) original nomenclature (muda):\\n\\nFaster-than-necessary pace: creating too much of a good or service that damages production flow, quality, and productivity. Previously referred to as overproduction, and leads to storage and lead time waste.\\nWaiting: any time goods are not being transported or worked on.\\nConveyance: the process by which goods are moved around. Previously referred to as transport, and includes double-handling and excessive movement.\\nProcessing: an overly complex solution for a simple procedure. Previously referred to as inappropriate processing, and includes unsafe production. This typically leads to poor layout and communication, and unnecessary motion.\\nExcess stock: an overabundance of inventory which results in greater lead times, increased difficulty identifying problems, and significant storage costs. Previously referred to as unnecessary inventory.\\nUnnecessary motion: ergonomic waste that requires employees to use excess energy such as picking up objects, bending, or stretching. Previously referred to as unnecessary movements, and usually avoidable.\\nCorrection of mistakes: any cost associated with defects or the resources required to correct them.\\n\\n\\n=== Waste removal operations ===\\nYasuhiro Monden (1994) identifies three types of operations:\\n\\nNon-value adding operations (NVA): actions that should be eliminated, such as waiting.\\nNecessary but non-value adding (NNVA): actions that are wasteful but necessary under current operating procedures.\\nValue-adding (VA): conversion or processing of raw materials via manual labor.\\nNNVA activities may also be referred to as \"sustaining non-value adding\", i.e. they have to be done, or they are necessary to sustain the business but do not contribute to customer requirements.\\nFor additional views on waste, see Lean manufacturing.\\n\\n\\n== Using the method ==\\nThere are two kinds of value stream maps, current state and future state. The current state value stream map is used to determine what the process currently looks like, the future state value stream map focuses on what the process will ideally look like after process improvements have occurred to the value stream.\\n\\nThe current state value stream map must be created before the future state map and is created by observing the process and tracking the information and material flow. The value stream map is then created using the following symbols:\\nIn a build-to-the-standard form, Shigeo Shingo suggests that the value-adding steps be drawn across the centre of the map and the non–value-adding steps be represented in vertical lines at right angles to the value stream. Thus, the activities become easily separated into the value stream, which is the focus of one type of attention, and the \"waste\" steps, another type. He calls the value stream the process and the non-value streams the operations. The thinking here is that the non–value-adding steps are often preparatory or tidying up to the value-adding step and are closely associated with the person or machine/workstation that executes that value-adding step. Therefore, each vertical line is the \"story\" of a person or workstation whilst the horizontal line represents the \"story\" of the product being created.\\nValue-stream mapping is a recognised method used as part of Lean Six Sigma methodologies.\\nValue-stream mapping analyzes both material (artifact) and information flow. The following two resources exemplify the use of VSM in the context of software process improvement in industrial settings:\\n\\n\"Artifact analysis\": analysis of software artifacts like requirements, use case, change request or defect report through the development process\\n\"Information flow analysis\": analysis of information flows in the development process\\n\\n\\n== Associated analysis methods ==\\nHines and Rich (1997) defined seven value-stream mapping tools. These are:\\n\\nProcess activity mapping: the initial step of constructing a map which consists of a study of process flows, waste identification, and business process re-engineering.\\nSupply chain response matrix: identifying critical bottlenecks for processes in a simple diagram.\\nProduction variety funnel: helps draw connections to other industries that may have solutions to existing problems.\\nForrester effect mapping: line graphs showing the customer demand and production, allowing visualisation of supply and demand and potential delays.\\nQuality filter mapping: locates product and service defects in the supply chain.\\nDecision point analysis: determines inflection points for push-and-pull demand in the supply chain.\\nPhysical structure mapping: combined model that overviews supply chain from an industry level.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nBusiness process mapping\\nLean manufacturing\\nValue-stream-mapping software\\nValue chain\\nValue stream\\n\\n\\n== Citations ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nProject Management Institute (2021).

       " 'The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model is a process reference model originally developed and endorsed by the Supply Chain Council, now a part of ASCM, as the cross-industry, standard diagnostic tool for supply chain management. The SCOR model describes the business activities associated with satisfying a customer\\'s demand, which include plan, source, make, deliver, return, and enable. Use of the model includes analyzing the current state of a company\\'s processes and goals, quantifying operational performance, and comparing company performance to benchmark data. SCOR has developed a set of metrics for supply chain performance, and ASCM members have formed industry groups to collect best practices information that companies can use to elevate their supply chain models.\\nThis reference model enables users to address, improve, and communicate supply chain management practices within and between all interested parties in the extended enterprise.\\nSCOR was developed in 1996 by the management consulting firm PRTM, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), and AMR Research, now part of Gartner, and endorsed by the Supply Chain Council, now part of ASCM, as the cross-industry de facto standard strategy, performance management, and process improvement diagnostic tool for supply chain management.\\n\\n\\n== SCOR DS ==\\nThe SCOR Digital Standard (DS) was released in 2019 and updated in 2022 to digitize the model to make it more accessible and then to better describe dynamic, asynchronous digital supply\\nchains, rather than the linear system presented by previous versions of the model. The 2022 update restructured the six major processes into the following processes:\\n\\nPlan.\\nSource.\\nTransform — essentially an expanded version of Make that applies to more types of manufacturers and service providers.\\nOrder — the first part of the split Deliver process.\\nFulfill — the second part of the split Deliver process.\\nReturn.\\nOrchestrate — a new focus on strategy, business rules, technology and human resources and their roles in supporting efficient supply chains.\\nThis new version of the model is illustrated as a type of infinity loop that reflects the modern\\nreality of supply chain networks, rather than linear supply chains and puts greater emphasis on\\ncollaboration, visibility and the effects of market drivers. The SCOR DS model is currently available for free. \\n\\n\\n== SCOR 1.0 - 12.0 Pillars ==\\nThe original version of the SCOR model was based on four major pillars:\\n\\nProcess modeling and re-engineering.\\nPerformance measurements.\\nBest practices.\\nSkills.\\n\\n\\n=== Process modeling ===\\nBy describing supply chains using process modeling building blocks, the model can be used to describe supply chains that are very simple or very complex using a common set of definitions. As a result, disparate industries can be linked to describe the depth and breadth of virtually any supply chain.\\nSCOR model 12.0 was based on six distinct management processes: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return, and Enable.\\n\\nPlan – Processes that balance aggregate demand and supply to develop a course of action that best meets sourcing, production, and delivery requirements.\\nSource – Processes that procure goods and services to meet planned or actual demand.\\nMake – Processes that transform product to a finished state to meet planned or actual demand.\\nDeliver – Processes that provide finished goods and services to meet planned or actual demand, typically including order management, transportation management, and distribution management.\\nReturn – Processes associated with returning or receiving returned products for any reason. These processes extend into post-delivery customer support.\\nEnable – Processes being associated with the management of the supply chain. These processes include management of business rules, performance, data, resources, facilities, contracts, supply chain network management, managing regulatory compliance, and risk management. The process is implemented in Version 11.0, released in December 2012.\\nWith all reference models, there is a specific scope that the model addresses. SCOR is no different, and the model focuses on the following:\\n\\nAll customer interactions, from order entry through paid invoice.\\nAll product (physical material and service) transactions, from your supplier\\'s supplier to your customer\\'s customer, including equipment, supplies, spare parts, bulk product, software, etc.\\nAll market interactions, from the understanding of aggregate demand to the fulfillment of each order.\\nSCOR does not attempt to describe every business process or activity. Relationships between these processes can be made to the SCOR model and some have been noted within the model. Other key assumptions addressed by SCOR include training, quality, information technology, and administration (not supply chain management). These areas are not explicitly addressed in the model but rather assumed to be a fundamental supporting process throughout the model.\\nSCOR provides three-levels of process detail. Each level of detail assists a company in defining scope (Level 1); configuration or type of supply chain (Level 2); and process element details, including performance attributes (Level 3). Beyond level 3, companies decompose process elements and start implementing specific supply chain management practices. It is at this stage that companies define practices to achieve a competitive advantage, and adapt to changing business conditions.\\nSCOR is a process reference model designed for effective communication among supply chain partners. As an industry standard, it also facilitates inter- and intra- supply chain collaboration and horizontal process integration by explaining the relationships between processes (i.e., Plan-Source, Plan-Make, etc.). It also can be used as a data input to completing an analysis of configuration alternatives (e.g., Level 2) such as: Make-to-Stock or Make-To-Order. SCOR is used to describe, measure, and evaluate supply chains in support of strategic planning and continuous improvement.\\n\\nThe picture shows different levels of the Make process. This means that the focus of the analysis will be concentrated on those processes that relate to the added-value activities that the model categorizes as Make processes.\\nLevel 2 includes 3 sub-processes that are children of the Make parent. These children have a special tag: a letter (M) and a number (1, 2, or 3).\\nThis is the syntax of the SCOR model. The letter represents the initial of the process. The numbers identify the scenario, or configuration.\\nM1 equals a \"Make Build to Stock\" scenario. Products or services are produced against a forecast.\\nM2 equals a \"Make Build to Order\" configuration. Products or services are produced against a real customer order in a just-in-time fashion.\\nM3 stands for the \"Make Engineer to Order\" configuration. In this case a blueprint of the final product is needed before any make activity can be performed.\\nLevel 3 processes, also referred to as the business activities within a configuration, represent the best-practice detailed processes that belong to each of the Level 2 parents.\\nThe example shows the breakdown of the Level 2 process \"Make Build to Order\" into its Level 3 components identified from M2.01 to M2.06.\\nOnce again this is the SCOR syntax: letter, number, dot,  and serial number.\\nThe model suggests that to perform a \"Make Build to Order\" process, there are 6 more detailed tasks that are usually performed. The model is not prescriptive, in the sense that it is not mandatory that all 6 processes are to be executed. It only represents what usually happens in the majority of organizations that compose the membership base of ASCM.\\nThe Level 3 processes reach a level of detail that cannot exceed the boundaries determined by the industry-agnostic and industry-standard nature of the SCOR model. Therefore, all the set of activities and processes that build, for instance the M2.03 \"Produce & Test\" process, will be company-specific and therefore fall outside the model\\'s scope.\\n\\n\\n=== Performance measurements ===\\nThe SCOR model contains more than 150 key performance indicators that measure the performance of supply chain operations. These performance metrics derive from the experience and contribution of the association\\'s members. As with the process modeling system, SCOR metrics are organized in a hierarchical structure: \\n\\nLevel 1 metrics are at the most aggregated level and are typically used by top decision-makers to measure the performance of the company\\'s overall supply chain.\\nLevel 2 metrics are primary, high-level measures that may cross multiple SCOR processes.\\nLevel 3 metrics do not necessarily relate to the SCOR Level 1 processes: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return and Enable.\\nThe metrics are used in conjunction with performance attributes. The performance attributes are characteristics of the supply chain that permit it to be analyzed and evaluated against other supply chains with competing strategies. Just as you would describe a physical object like a piece of lumber using standard characteristics (e.g., height, width, depth), a supply chain requires standard characteristics to be described. Without these characteristics it is extremely difficult to compare an organization that chooses to be the low-cost provider against an organization that chooses to compete on reliability and performance.\\nOne of the key aspects that needs to be considered is that the performance measurement and thus benchmarking is done at supply chain level and not at the organizational level. Supply chains are identified  with an organization based on customers and products. An organization that is offering multiple products will have multiple supply chains. In fact the supply chain to deliver the material and then return the material from customers will also be different.\\n\\nThen the supply chain that needs to be improved is identified. This could be based on multiple parameters, such as most or least profitable. Once the supply chain is identified, then only the performance measurement and benchmarking are done. Please note SCOR might not have the benchmarking data for all kinds of supply chains. For example, SCOR currently doesn\\'t have data for the catering supply chain in the airline industry. The point here is that SCOR is for improving supply chains in an organization, and the premise is that if a single supply chain is improved, it has ripple effects on the whole organization.\\nAssociated with the performance attributes are the Level 1 metrics. These Level 1 metrics are the calculations by which an implementing organization can measure how successful they are in achieving their desired positioning within the competitive market space.\\nThe metrics in the model are hierarchical, just as the process elements are hierarchical. Level 1 metrics are created from lower-level calculations.\\n(Level 1 metrics are primary, high-level measures that may cross multiple SCOR processes. Level 1 metrics do not necessarily relate to a SCOR Level 1 process (Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return, or Enable).\\nLower-level calculations (Level 2 metrics) are generally associated with a narrower subset of processes. For example, Delivery Performance is calculated as the total number of products delivered on time and in full based on a commit date.\\n\\n\\n=== Best practices ===\\nOnce the performance of the supply chain operations has been measured and performance gaps identified, it becomes important to identify what activities should be performed to close those gaps. More than 430 executable practices derived from the experience of association members are available.\\nThe SCOR model defines a best practice as a current, structured, proven and repeatable method for making a positive impact on desired operational results.\\n\\nCurrent – Must not be emerging (bleeding edge) and must not be antiquated.\\nStructured – Has a clearly stated goal, scope, process, and procedure.\\nProven – Shows demonstrated success in a working environment.\\nRepeatable – Has been proven in multiple environments.\\nMethod – Is used in a very broad sense to indicate a business process, a practice, an organizational strategy, an enabling technology, a business relationship, a business model, as well as information or knowledge management.\\nPositive impact on desired operational results\\nThe practice shows operational improvement related to the stated goal and could be linked to key metric(s). The impact should show either as gain (increase in speed, revenues, quality) or reduction (resource utilizations, costs, loss, returns, etc.).\\n\\n\\n== Use example based on SCOR 1.0 to SCOR 12.0 ==\\n\\nSCOR improves on this by offering a \"standard\" solution.  The first step is to recover the Level 1 and Level 2 process descriptions.\\n\\nThe example is of a simple supply chain.\\nThe picture alone cannot adequately describe what production strategy the manufacturing company has decided to adopt. It is no easier to figure out how the material is supplied from the two suppliers. For example, is the material delivered against a forecast or is it pulled based on real consumption?\\nEven in its apparent simplicity, this picture does not represent a standard. Without a more extensive description, the picture does not help interpret what is actually happening in this supply chain. Descriptive text could be added to the images to help explain the whole process. In order to keep the example simple and direct, it focuses only on the central processes: Source, Make, and Deliver.  This reflects the general practice of members who focus first of all on these three process scopes. Only in a second step do they apply Plan and Return to map all their supply chain processes.\\nThe example is of a manufacturing company that produces against a 15-day forecast. The key word here is forecast. What is the SCOR scenario that resembles a production based on a forecast? The answer is, M1 \"Make Build to Stock\".\\nHow does the company supply materials from the Far East? The diagram explains that the company supplies raw materials in bulk from the Far East against a monthly forecast. Forecast is again the key word. How should a process of supply based on a forecast be represented?\\nThe process is Source. The picture from the SCOR manual shows that the process S1 “Source Stocked Product” exactly corresponds to the needs of this example.\\nWith the French supplier, the company pulls components from France based on production volumes. The key word here is pulls, as it describes a just-in-time strategy adopted with this supplier. What is the syntax used by SCOR to represent a pull-mode supply?\\nThe Source process descriptions in SCOR 12.0 offers a description that resonates well with the needs of the example: S2 “Source Make-to-Order Product”.\\nLastly, the distribution strategy chosen by the manufacturing company is to ship weekly finished goods to a distribution warehouse based in Central Europe. The description suggests that a weekly shipment is closer to a forecast-based rather than a just-in-time policy. A shipment is a delivery process, so we must look under the Deliver tree. By browsing the Level 2 processes in the model, we must look for a process configuration that corresponds to the forecast-based policy. We find that in D1 “Deliver Stocked Product.”\\nThe SCOR paradigm demands that whenever a unit of the supply chain sources, there must be some other unit that delivers. Similarly, any delivery process requires a corresponding sourcing process at the other end of the link.  So the mapping of the processes of the supply chain is completed, and can be depicted as in the following illustration.\\nWe see now that we don\\'t need any more the descriptions in the boxes. By just reading the SCOR syntax we immediately capture the salient processes that occur in this chain.\\nThe syntax of the model allows professionals to speak the same language. As a matter of fact, if we were to use the “orthodox” representation of a SCOR mapping, we would build a thread diagram like the one in the below picture. This is perfectly correspondent to the initial geographical picture, but it contains much more embedded information (we can call it a meta-model) in a more structured and elegant way. The arrows themselves represent the direction of the material flow.\\n\\n\\n== Supply chain modeling ==\\nThe implementation of the SCOR model helps with the utilization of the supply chain model. Companies usually integrate SCOR into their existing practices, which helps them reach their business goals and optimize their activities.\\nA project that includes the SCOR model is usually built in these steps:\\n\\nUnderstanding of the scope - configuration, performance, opportunity.\\nInvestigation of causes - problem discovery, classification of challenges.\\nIdentification of solutions - research and development of alternative solutions.\\nDesign of solutions - documentation (processes, organizational design, work instructions, etc.).\\nLaunch of the project - definition of the project, critical path, and project portfolio.\\n\\n\\n== People ==\\nThe People section includes a standard that is used for description of skills that are required to perform a specific task and to manage those processes. In general, these skills are specific to the supply chain, where some can be found as applicable outside the supply chain field as well.\\nSkills are defined by Trainings, Experiences, Aptitudes, and Competency level. The latter is further divided into five widely accepted competency levels: Novice, beginner, competent, proficient, and expert. \\n\\nNovice: Unqualified beginner without past experience, requires detailed documentation.\\nBeginner: Able to perform the tasks, limited situational perception present.\\nCompetent: Understanding of tasks, able to define priorities to successfully finish the task.\\nProficient: Able to oversee the main aspects of the task, advanced situational perception.\\nExpert: Able to apply patterns from experience into new situations.\\nThe competency levels are most commonly used as practice or process maturity levels. In addition, the job specification or a person is evaluated as the difference between the real (people) and planned (job specification) level of competency.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nPeter Bolstorff; Robert Rosenbaum (2003).

       " 'Management accounting in supply chains (or supply chain controlling, SCC) is part of the supply chain management concept. This necessitates planning, monitoring, management and information about logistics and manufacturing processes throughout the value chain. The goal of management accounting in supply chains is to optimise these processes. This strategy focuses on supporting management.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nAs value chains become more complex due to globalization, supply chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice. SCM encompasses extensive management-control tasks. This range of subjects is summarized by the definition of supply-chain controlling. The transfer of existing management control systems (MCM) to the SCM is insufficient because these primarily aim at internal (company) needs. Beyond past-oriented, financial figures there must also be future-oriented measurement; a number of approaches exist in the literature.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nSupply-chain management (SCM) has become increasingly relevant in theory and practice in light of more-complex supply chains. The SCM performs extensive operational tasks, including supply-chain controlling. Seuring transfers the three main concepts of German supply chain-controlling literature into the specific demands of SCM:\\n\\nThe rationality-oriented approach of supply-chain controlling coordinates all participants in the supply chain to improve performance. Common management systems and instruments for performance measurement are developed, enabling guidance for individual companies and the entire supply chain. The coordination-oriented approach supports the supply-chain leadership. Organizational objectives include the selection of strategic partners, the distribution of tasks among companies, process management and ensuring the provision of information to all participants. The information-oriented supply-chain controlling concept emphasizes providing partners with relevant information for decision-making. An efficient reporting structure must be implemented, including strategic and operative organizations in the system and their technical aspects.\\n\\n\\n== Requirements ==\\nA requirement for the supply chain is the support of cooperating companies, ensuring future cooperation; companies must focus on common tools and targets. For this, an understanding of processes within the participating companies is indispensable. Information exchange (including sensitive data) within a supply chain is necessary to ensure its control, with coordination among in-house information systems. The requirements for management accounting in supply chains are significantly higher than the provision of key figures, but this is a fundamental task.\\n\\n\\n== Tasks and functions ==\\nThe tasks and functions of controlling may be transferred to management accounting in supply chains, supplemented by a cross-company approach. However, the past-oriented aspects of the traditional concept are inappropriate. Due to the strategic importance of supply-chain management, forward-looking control requirements must be taken into account. Because of the complexity of a supply chain, a focus on interface management is necessary. In the literature, several tasks and functions are defined. Management accounting in supply chains has the following features:\\n\\nPlanning\\nMonitoring and control\\nInformation supply\\nCoordination\\nRationality and reflection\\n\\n\\n== Aims ==\\nBecause of different controlling directions, in management accounting of supply chains different aims are pursued and influence each other. Again, the challenge is the cross-company factor. Independent companies must agree on a common strategy for the SCM and define common aims. Two types of aims exist: direct and indirect.\\n\\n\\n=== Direct ===\\nDirect aims relate to the support of SCM and controlling. This ensures logistical processes between parties in a supply chain or the introduction of a common performance-measurement system for verification of lead times.\\n\\n\\n=== Indirect ===\\nCompany-wide, generalized aims may be pursued with management accounting in supply chains. Examples are competitiveness, expanding cooperation, growth, market development and greater customer orientation.\\n\\n\\n== Instruments ==\\nManagement accounting in supply chains draws on modified traditional instruments of managerial accounting to accomplish cross-company objectives. There are two measuring instruments: the supply-chain map and the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR).\\n\\n\\n=== Supply-chain scorecard ===\\nThe basic model of the balanced scorecard (BSC) was introduced by Kaplan and Norton in 1992. The BSC aims to achieve a balance between non-financial and financial measures. To use the scorecard in a cross-company context, several modifications of content and structure are necessary. The BSC consists of four generic perspectives, which are geared to the individual company. According to this, a generally accepted framework does not exist. From a common strategy, the supply-chain scorecard (SCS) maps cross-company measures. Brewer and Speh note that focusing on the supply chain requires four perspectives: \\n\\nFinancial benefits\\nSupply chain-management (SCM) goals\\nSCM improvement\\nEnd customer benefits\\nIndependent of perspective, each should include internal and cross-company measures.\\n\\n\\n=== Cross-company activity-based costing ===\\nActivity-based costing is a model to assign indirect costs into direct ones. To use this model in the context of supply chains, there must be consistent defined and delimited cost and performance data. Since many companies participate in more than one supply chain, standardization across the sector is beneficial. Compatibility of information technology is important for improved data transfer, so manual entry is limited and high availability guaranteed. Several changes result from cross-company activity-based costing:\\n\\nDetermination of supply-chain efficiency (aggregate of cost and performance data)\\nDetailed cost analysis (for decisions)\\nProcess benchmarking between supply-chain members\\nRealization of target costs\\n\\n\\n=== Supply-chain performance-measurement system ===\\nA primary task of management accounting in supply chains is performance measurement. The key elements of strategic goals include the measurement of resources, output and flexibility. Efficient resource management is critical to profitability; without an acceptable output, customers will turn to other supply chains. In a changing environment, supply chains must adapt.\\nMeasures for resource performance include total costs, distribution costs, manufacturing costs, measures of inventory and rate of return. Examples of performance measures are numbers of items produced, time required to produce, customer satisfaction and product quality (which is difficult to express numerically). Reductions in  back orders, increased customer satisfaction and the ability to accommodate demand variations are advantages associated with flexibility.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nSupply chain\\nSupply chain management\\nManagement control system\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nBeamon, B.M.

       " 'Green supply chain management (GSCM)  is the consideration of environmental issues in supply chain management.\\n\\n\\n== Definitions and scope ==\\nGSCM has been defined as the following:\\n\\n“GSCM encompasses a set of environmental practices that encourage improvements to the environmental practices of two or more organizations within the same supply chain”\\n“GSCM is the process of incorporating environmental concerns into supply chain management including product design, material sourcing and selection, manufacturing, delivery of final products, and the management of product’s end-of-life”\\n“GSCM can be achieved by considering environmental issues at the purchasing, product design and development, production, transportation, packaging, storage, disposal, and end of product life cycle management stages.”\\n“GSCM is the integration of environmental concerns in the inter-organizational practices of supply chain management”\\nSrivastava (2007) defines GSCM’s scope as ranging \"from reactive monitoring of general environmental management programs to more proactive practices implemented through various Rs (Reduce, Re-use, Rework, Refurbish, Reclaim, Recycle, Remanufacture, Reverse logistics, etc.).” From an entrepreneurial perspective, entrepreneurial GSCM is a new approach to environmental management executed by green entrepreneurs across whole supply chains instead of thinking in terms of individual non-environmental firms. This new holistic view can integrate individuals, companies, and supply-chains of different entrepreneurs from various countries together in an environmental friendly way.\\n\\n\\n== GSCM criteria ==\\nA nonexhaustive list of GSCM criteria from D. Kannan et al. (2014) is given below. \\n\\nGSCM Criteria 1\\n“Commitment of senior management to GSCM”\\n“The support of senior management is crucial in GSCM adoption, as there will be an eventual need for process adjustments or cultural changes”\\nGSCM Criteria 2\\n“Inter-functional cooperation for environmental improvement”\\n“Inter-functional cooperation (e.g., purchases and sustainability, research and development in sustainability, or marketing and stability, etc.) is important in implementing changes in the day-today activities of the functional areas. This type of cooperation can therefore promote environmental requirements externally via upstream suppliers, or internally via consumer demand”\\nGSCM Criteria 3\\n“Compliance with legal environmental requirements and auditing programs”\\n“Addressing environmental legal requirements and auditing programs demonstrates that the company is attempting to meet environmental regulation for their sector internally”\\nGSCM Criteria 4\\n“ISO 14001 Certification”\\n“The company has an ISO 14001 certified EMS”\\nGSCM Criteria 5\\n“Selection of suppliers includes environmental criteria”\\nExplanation – “The selection process for suppliers considers environmental variables (e.g., ISO 14001) in addition to traditional criteria (e.g., cost, quality, reliability, etc.)”\\nGSCM Criteria 6\\n“Work with suppliers to meet environmental goals”\\n“Suppliers are asked to support initiatives and measures within their company to improve the environment”\\nGSCM Criteria 7\\n“Evaluations of the internal environmental management of suppliers”\\n“Inspections of supplier installations provide a way to check the environmental performance of the supplier and ensure that they comply with environmental management standards”\\nGSCM Criteria 8\\n“Evaluation of the environmental management of 2nd-tier suppliers”\\n“Suppliers of basic raw materials are also monitored to extend environmental concern beyond the direct relationship”\\nGSCM Criteria 9\\n“Work with clients for eco-design”\\n“Utilizing the close relationships that traditional supply chain management allows, companies seek to develop products together with clients to improve the products’ environmental impact”\\nGSCM Criteria 10\\n“Work with clients to make production cleaner”\\n“Utilizing the close relationships that traditional supply chain management allows, companies seek to manufacture more cleanly with cooperation from the client”\\nGSCM Criteria 11\\n“Work with clients to use environmentally friendly packaging”\\n“Utilizing the close relationships that traditional supply chain management allows, companies seek to use environmentally friendly packaging with cooperation from clients”\\nGSCM Criteria 12\\n“Acquisition of the cleanest technologies by the company”\\n“The company buys equipment that allows it to make products as cleanly as possible”\\nGSCM Criteria 13\\n“Product designs that reduce, reuse, recycle, or reclaim materials, components, or energy”\\n“The company observes policies on material reduction, parts reuse, recycling of the product after use, and recuperation of materials, components, or energy throughout the product’s life”\\nGSCM Criteria 14\\n“Product designs that avoid or reduce toxic or hazardous material use”\\n“In developing products, the company incorporates ways to avoid or reduce the use of dangerous or toxic products”]1\\nGSCM Criteria 15\\n“Sale of excess stock or materials”\\n“The company seeks to sell obsolete stock to recuperate its investment”\\nGSCM Criteria 16\\n“Sale of scrap and used materials”\\n“The company seeks to sell waste and used materials (i.e., materials that do not have value in the production line) to recuperate its investment”\\nGSCM Criteria 17\\n“Sale of used equipment (after buying new equipment)”\\n“The company sells used equipment to recuperate its investment”\\n\\n\\n=== Relative importance of criteria ===\\nInstead of concentrating equally on every criterion, more attention should be given to the most important criteria. D. Kannan et al. (2014) calculated the importance of criteria by taking the preferences of 3 decision-makers:\\n\\nIn this table, the preferences of criteria are given in terms of linguistic variables. From these linguistic variables, calculations were done to find out the ranking of the importance of criteria. \\n\\nForm the above graph; it is clear that the top 4 most important GSCM criteria are\\t\\n\\nGSCM Criteria 1 : “Commitment of senior management to GSCM”\\nGSCM Criteria 13 : “Product designs that reduce, reuse, recycle, or reclaim materials, components, or energy”\\nGSCM Criteria 3 : “Compliance with legal environmental requirements and auditing programs”\\nGSCM Criteria 14 : “Product designs that avoid or reduce toxic or hazardous material use”\\nThis result was obtained when the authors considered the GSCM criteria for choosing a supplier for an electronics company in Brazil (a developing country). Depending on the situation, it is possible that other GSCM criteria are deemed to be more important by the decision-makers. (For example, if the same research were done in a developed country instead of a developing country, other criteria might have received a higher ranking).\\n\\n\\n== Barriers ==\\nTumpa et al., 2019 conducted a study to find the hurdles faced while implementing GSCM practices. The study was conducted in the textile industry of Bangladesh (a developing country). Some of the most important hurdles were found out to be\\n\\nlow demand from customers due to lack of awareness\\nfinancial constraint\\nlack of government regulations\\nOther hurdles may be more important in different situations (Example – if the study were done in a developed country instead of a developing country)\\nAnother considerable hurdle for firms trying to implement GSCM practices is the fact that many suppliers along the complete supply chain reside outside of any direct organizational control from the firm. Supply chains are often built upon a network of individual suppliers and a firm\\'s ability to meet their Corporate Sustainability Standards can be hindered by suppliers with which they do not directly interact. \\n\\n\\n== Relevance ==\\nIncrease in publications\\nThe number of publications on GSCM has been increasing for the past few years. The figure below shows the number of publications on GSCM from the year 2006 to 2016. By observing the figure, we can find an increasing trend in the number of publications in GSCM. This increase is likely the effect of the rising significance of environmental concerns in the area of supply chain management.\\nFigure of Increase in publications is mentioned (data from de Oliveira (2018) et al.)\\n\\n“It is expected to see the GSCM publication increase trend perceivable for the next years.”\\nBoth developed and developing countries are doing research on GSCM.\\nResearch on GSCM is being done by both developed and developing countries. The figure below shows the number of publications from the top 10 countries\\nFigure of publications from various countries is mentioned (data from de Oliveira (2018) et al.)\\n\\nFrom the figure, it is clear that both developed countries like the U.S.A. and developing countries like India and China are conducting research on GSCM. This is also due to the rising importance of environmental issues in the context of supply chain management.\\n\\n\\n== References ==',\n",
       " \"The electric vehicle supply chain comprises the mining and refining of raw materials and the manufacturing processes that produce batteries and other components for electric vehicles. \\n\\n\\n== Batteries ==\\n \\nThe electric vehicle battery accounts for 30–40% of the value of the vehicle. There is rapidly growing demand for its components because of growth in the electric vehicle market as well as in battery storage power stations. This is driven largely by the ongoing transition to renewable energy. \\nThe Li-NMC type uses the critical minerals lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese.  This imposes limits on large-scale adoption of this type.  These three elements are concentrated in only 12 countries, with Australia being the only country that has all three.\\nThe Lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP), which has become the leading technology in China, is more sustainable. The sodium-ion battery (Na-ion) completely avoids the need for critical minerals.\\n\\nSecuring the supply chain for these materials is a major world economic issue. It has been estimated that battery recycling can provide up to 60% of market demand for the three critical elements. Recycling and advancement in battery technology are proposed strategies to reduce demand for raw materials. Recyling lithium-ion batteries in particular reduces energy consumption. Supply chain issues could create bottlenecks, increase costs of EVs and slow their uptake. Nations set up incentives for domestic growth in the market, to further secure their stake in the supply chain.\\nDeposits of critical minerals are concentrated in a small number of countries, mostly in the Global South. Mining these deposits presents dangers to nearby communities because of weak regulation, corruption, and environmental degradation.  The mining impacts the quality of the food and water local communities depend upon, and the metals end up in their bodies. Miners also experience low pay, dangerous conditions, and violent treatment. Electric vehicles require more of these critical minerals than most cars, amplifying these effects. These communities face human rights violations, environmental justice issues, problems with child labour, and potentially generational legacies of contamination from mining activities. Environmental justice issues arising from the supply chain affect the entire globe, through depredation of the atmosphere from pollution byproduct. Manufacture of battery technology is largely dominated by China. However, burning less petroleum products in vehicles can reduce the environmental impact of the petroleum industry because, as of 2023, most petroleum is used in vehicles.\\nThe battery supply chain includes:\\nUpstream activities include mining for required raw materials, which include critical materials such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, manganese, and graphite as well as other required minerals such as copper.\\nMidstream activities include refining and smelting of raw mineral ores with heat or chemical treatment to achieve the high-purity materials required for batteries, as well as the manufacture of cathodes and anodes for battery cells. Lower environmental impacts for refining can be achieved by decarbonized electricity generation, automated process control, exhaust gas cleaning, and recycling used electrolytes.\\nDownstream activities include manufacturing of the batteries and end goods for the consumer.  The production of lithium batteries in China has nearly three times higher emissions than the US because electricity generation in China relies more on coal.\\nEnd of life activities include recycling or recovery of materials when possible.\\nDisposal of spent LIBs without recycling could be detrimental to the environment. Recycling lithium-ion batteries reduces energy consumption, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and results in 51.3% natural resource savings when compared to discarding them in landfills. Recycling can potentially lower the overall energy emissions of battery production as the LIB recycling industry grows larger. When not recycled, the disposal of cobalt extraction involves non-sulfidic tailings, which has an impact on land use. Even in the recycling process, CO2 emissions are still produced, continuing to impact the environment regardless of how LIBs are disposed.\\nRecycling of battery minerals is limited but is expected to rise in the 2030s when there are more spent batteries. Increasing recycling would bring considerable social and environmental benefits.\\n\\n\\n=== Countries roles in the supply chain ===\\nChina dominates the electric car industry, accounting for three-quarters of global lithium-ion battery production. Most refining of lithium, cobalt, and graphite takes place in China. Japan and Korea host significant midstream cell manufacturing and downstream supply chain activities. Europe and the United States have a relatively small share of the supply chain.\\nIn 2021, 3.3 million EVs were sold in China, up 400% from 2019 and higher than the global sales in 2020.\\nUpstream activities (mining and processing) largely take place in countries with extractivist economies such as Australia, Chile, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\\n\\n\\n=== Other components ===\\nEVs have fewer parts than ICEs. On average, a motor for an electric car has about 20 moving parts, but a comparable ICE would have 200 or more.\\nSome electric vehicles motors are permanent magnet motors that require rare-earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium. Production of these materials is also dominated by China and poses environmental problems. An alternative motor is the AC induction motor, which does not use these minerals but requires additional copper.\\nThese components also contribute to the environmental justice issues caused by the extraction of cobalt and other mineral resources, just as batteries do. Radioactive dust and mine sewage from mining for these resources contribute to environmental impacts. Another aspect of the pipeline, metal refining, contributes to the environmental impacts through production of electrolytes, electricity consumption, and used cathodes. Used Cathodes amplify the toxicity of marine ecosystems by the leaching of heavy metals during the smelting process. The result of cobalt presence in the soil is its accumulation in plants, and their fruits. High cobalt amounts accumulate in the rest of the food chain, reaching land and air animals. Effects of excess cobalt include lower animal weight gain and a higher birth mortality.\\nElectric vehicles require more semiconductors than internal combustion engines (ICEs). Taiwan is the world's largest producer of semiconductors.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nInternational commitments reflected in the Paris Agreement have led to efforts toward a renewable energy transition as a strategy for climate change mitigation. Green capitalism and sustainable development approaches have informed policy in many countries of the Global North, resulting in rapid growth of the electric vehicle industry, and resulting demands for raw materials. Mainstream projections for electric vehicle uptake assume that there will be more cars in the future.\\n\\n\\n== Environmental justice issues ==\\n\\nSupply chain risks include sustainability challenges, political instability and corruption in countries with mineral deposits, and human rights or environmental justice concerns. The supply of critical minerals is concentrated in a few countries: for example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo produced 74% of the world's cobalt in 2022. Extreme weather events, geopolitical issues, international trade regulation, consolidation of supply chain companies into a few large corporations, and rapidly changing technologies all present additional challenges to building a resilient supply chain. Mineral extraction in the Global South for manufacturing of batteries and vehicles consumed in the Global North may replicate historical patterns of injustice and colonialism.\\nHowever electric vehicles are better for the environment than fossil-fuelled vehicles. The supply chain for fossil-fuelled vehicles is mostly petroleum (for a typical car around 17 tonnes of gasoline), and can be complicated and obscure. Burning less petroleum products in vehicles such as two-wheelers can reduce the environmental impact of the petroleum industry because, as of 2023, most petroleum is used in vehicles.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\",\n",

       " 'A global value chain (GVC) refers to the full range of activities that economic actors engage in to bring a product to market. The global value chain does not only involve production processes, but preproduction (such as design) and postproduction processes (such as marketing and distribution).\\nGVC is similar to Industry Level Value Chain but encompasses operations at the global level. GVC is similar to the concept of a supply chain, but the latter focuses on conveyance of materials and products between locations, often including change of ownership of those materials and products. The existence of a global value chain (i.e. where different stages in the production and consumption of materials and products of value take place in different parts of the world) implies a global supply chain engaged in the movement of those materials and products on a global basis.\\n\\n\\n== In development ==\\nThe first references to the concept of a global value chain date from the mid-1990s. Early references were enthusiastic about the upgrading prospects for developing countries that joined them. In his early work based on research on East Asian garment firms, Gary Gereffi, the pioneer in value chain analysis, describes a process of almost ‘natural’ learning and upgrading for the firms which participated in GVCs. This echoed the ‘export-led’ discourse of the World Bank in the ‘East Asian Miracle’ report based on the East Asian ‘Tigers’ success. In economics, GVC was first formalized in a paper by Hummels, Ishii and Yi in 2001. They defined GVC as the foreign component of imported intermediate inputs used to produce output, and some fraction of output is subsequently exported. Allowing for such a framework, Kei-Mu Yi showed in a 2003 paper that the growth of world trade can be explained with moderate changes in the trade costs and named this phenomenon \"vertical specialization\".\\nThis encouraged the World Bank and other leading institutions to encourage developing firms to develop their indigenous capabilities through a process of upgrading technical capabilities to meet global standards with leading multinational enterprises (MNE) playing a key role in helping local firms through transfer of new technology, skills and knowledge.\\nWider adoption of open source hardware technology used for digital fabrication such as 3D printers like the RepRap has the potential to partially reverse the trend towards global specialization of production systems into elements that may be geographically dispersed and closer to the end users (localization) and thus disrupt global value chains.\\n\\n\\n=== Analytical framework ===\\nGlobal value chains are a network of production and trade across countries. The study of global value chains requires inevitably a trade theory that can treat input trade. However, mainstream trade theories (Heckshcer-Ohlin-Samuelson model and New trade theory and New new trade theory) are only concerned with final goods. It needs a New new new trade theory. Escaith and Miroudot estimates that the Ricardian trade model in its extended form has \"the advantage\" of being better suited to the analysis of global value chains. Shiozawa argued that global value chains can be treated by the new theory of international values, because it is a general theory of input trade with many-country, many-product economy. He contends that global value chains are a new transforming general purpose technology.\\nThe lack of appropriate tool of analysis, the studies of GVCs were initially conducted mainly by sociologists like Gary Gereffi, and management science researchers. See for a genealogy Jennifer Bair (2009). This is changing, with more studies by means of global Input-Output Table starting by economists, and economic geographers outlining the case for proactive sub-national public policy on the engagement of GVCs.\\n\\n\\n=== Development and upgrading ===\\nGVCs become a major topic in development economics especially for middle-income countries, because the \"upgrading\" within GVCs became the crucial condition for the sustained growth of those countries.\\nGVC analysis views “upgrading” as a continuum starting with “process upgrading” (e.g. a producer adopts better technology to improve efficiency), then moves on to “product upgrading” where the quality or functionality of the product is upgraded by using higher quality material or a better quality management system (QMS), and then on to “functional upgrading” in which the firm begins to design its own product and develops marketing and branding capabilities and begins to supply to end markets/customers directly - often by targeting geographies or customers (which are not served by its existing multinational clients). Subsequently, the process of upgrading might also cover inter-sectoral upgrading.\\nFunctional upgrading to high-value-added activities like design and branding is for developing country suppliers a key opportunity to achieve higher profits in GVC. Likewise, a 2017 review of the empirical literature highlighted that suppliers operating in unstable economies, like Pakistan and Bangladesh, face high barriers to reach functional upgrading in high-value-added activities.\\nThis upgrading process in GVCs has been challenged by other researchers – some of whom argue that insertion in global value chains does not always lead to upgrading. Some authors argue that the expected upgrading process might not hold for all types of upgrading. Specifically they argue upgrading into design, marketing and branding might be hindered by exporting under certain conditions because MNEs have no interest in transferring these core skills to their suppliers thus preventing them from accessing global markets (except as a supplier) for first world customer. Other authors point to the benefits of considering upgrading at a regional, or sub-national level. This focus enhances the possibility that less-developed regions capture the gains from GVC insertion.\\n\\n\\n=== Current research on governance and its impact from a development perspective ===\\nThere are motivations behind renewed interest in global value chains and the opportunities that they may present for countries in South Asia. A 2013 report found that looking at the production chain, rather than the individual stages of production, is more helpful. Individual donors with their own priorities and expertise cannot be expected to provide comprehensive response to the needs identified, not to mention the legal responsibilities of many specialist agencies. The research suggests they adjust their priorities and modalities to the way production chains operate, and to coordinate with other donors to cover all trade needs. It calls for donors and governments to work together to assess how aid flows may affect power relationships.\\nIn his 1994 paper, Gereffi identified two major types of governance. The first were buyer-driven chains, where the lead firms are final buyers such as retail chains and branded product producers such as non-durable final consumer products (e.g., clothing, footwear and food). The second governance type identified by Gereffi were producer-driven chains. Here the technological competences of the lead firms (generally upstream in the chain) defined the chain\\'s competitiveness.\\nCurrent research suggests that GVCs exhibit a variety of characteristics and impact communities in a variety of ways. In a paper that emerged from the deliberations of the GVC Initiative, five GVC governance patterns were identified:\\n\\nHierarchical chains represent the fully internalized operations of vertically integrated firms.\\nQuasi-hierarchical (or captive chains) involve suppliers or intermediate customers with low levels of capabilities, who require high levels of support and are the subject of well-developed supply chain management from lead firms (often called the chain governor).\\nRelational and modular chain governance exhibit durable relations between lead firms and their suppliers and customers in the chain, but with low levels of chain governance often because the main suppliers in the chain possess their own unique competences (and/or infrastructure) and can operate independently of the lead firm.\\nMarket chains represent the classic arms length relationships found in many commodity markets.\\nAs capabilities in many low- and middle-income economies have grown, chain governance has tended to move away from quasi-hierarchical models toward modular type as this form of governance reduces the costs of supply chain management and allows chain governors to maintain a healthy level of competition in their supply chains. However, whilst it maintains short-term competition in the supply chain, it has allowed some leading intermediaries to develop considerable functional competences (e.g., design and branding). In the long term these have the potential to emerge as competitors to their original chain governor. Other study outlines the initiative to promote inclusive GVC, three GVC patterns were identified:\\nThe theoretical concepts often considered firms as operating in a single value chain (with a single customer). Whilst this was often the case in quasi-hierarchical chains (with considerable customer power) it has become apparent that some firms operate in multiple value chains (subject to multiple forms of governance) and serve both national and international markets and that this plays a role in the development of firm capabilities. The recent trend in GVC research shows exploration of issue emerging from the interaction of different stakeholders from within and outside the GVC structures and their effects on the sustainability of the GVCs. For examples, the local governance institutions and production firms.\\n\\n\\n=== Summary of Unctad report: global value chains and development ===\\nIn 2013, UNCTAD published two reports on GVCs and their contribution to development. They concluded that:\\n\\nGVCs make a significant contribution to international development. Value-added trade contributes about 30% to the GDP of developing countries, significantly more than it does in developed countries (18%) furthermore the level of participation in GVCs is associated with stronger levels of GDP per capita growth. GVCs thus have a direct impact on the economy, employment and income and create opportunities for development. They can also be an important mechanism for developing countries enhance productive capacity, by increasing the rate of adoption of technology and through workforce skill development, thus building the foundations for long-term industrial upgrading.\\nHowever, there are limitations to the GVC approach. Their contribution to the growth may be limited if the work done in-country is relatively low value adding (i.e. contributes only a small part of the total value added for the product or service). In addition there is no automatic process that guarantees diffusion of technology, skill-building and upgrading. Developing countries thus face the risk of operating in permanently low value-added activities. Finally, there are potential negative impacts on the environment and social conditions, including: poor workplace conditions, occupational safety and health, and job security. The relative ease with which the Value Chain Governors can relocate their production (often to lower cost countries) also create additional risks.\\nCountries need to carefully assess the pros and cons of GVC participation and the costs and benefits of proactive policies to promote GVCs or GVC-led development strategies. Promoting GVC participation implies targeting specific GVC segments and GVC participation can only form one part of a country\\'s overall development strategy.\\nBefore promoting GVC participation, policymakers should evaluate their countries’ trade profiles and industrial capabilities in order to select strategic GVC development paths. Achieving upgrading opportunities through CVCs requires a structured approach that includes:\\nembedding GVCs in industrial development policies (e.g. targeting GVC tasks and activities);\\nenabling GVC growth by providing the right framework conditions for trade and FDI and by putting in place the needed infrastructure; and\\ndeveloping firm capabilities and training the local workforce.\\n\\n\\n== Gender and global value chains ==\\n\\nGender plays a prominent role in global value chains, because it influences consumption patterns within the United States, and thus affects production on a larger scale. In turn, specific roles within the value chain are also determined by gender, making gender a key component in the process as well. The increase in global sourcing of production has created more and more work in the informal sector as labor intensive assembly work is being put out to homeworkers in the informal sector where women work as self employed traders and producers, casual workers, or sub contract workers. Far more women than men are found in the informal sector, as self-employed workers or subcontractors, while specific jobs and broader fields of work differ between men and women. In more than 90 percent of Sub-Saharan African countries, 89 percent of Southern Asian countries, and 75 percent of Latin American countries, women are more exposed to informal work.\\nEducation levels, legal barriers, and social norms, are all factors that contribute to women being largely concentrated in informal work across global value chains. Work in the informal sector is primarily held by low-skill workers with little to no education. Because labor in the informal sector requires low levels of skill, individuals who are looking for work but lack a strong education frequently find work in the informal sector. Women tend to receive less education than men, in sub-Saharan Africa, women only receive 70 percent of the schooling that men do. Women\\'s concentration in the informal sector is also influenced by social norms. In Senegal, women spend six times as much time as men caring for their families and completing household chores. The time spend in unpaid care labor puts constraints on women\\'s ability to find formal work within a global value chain. Women seeking jobs in the formal sector face extra challenges due to legal barriers. Many Sub-Saharan African countries, for example, prohibit women from signing work contracts or opening bank accounts without their husband\\'s permission.\\nWithin global value chains, the distribution of returns between firms in the formal sector and women in the informal sector is disproportionate. In Zimbabwe\\'s non-traditional agricultural exports value chains (NTAE), women accounted for only 12% of total costs while exporters accounted for 30% importers for 12% and retailers for 46% of costs.\\n\\n\\n== Sustainability and global value chains ==\\nSustainability is an increasingly important factor in global value chains, and there is a growing need to evaluate their performance based on social and environmental impact, as well as economic. Initiatives such as The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals encourage sustainable practices through its 17-goal blueprint, but there are few enforced policies which address sustainability with the urgency required to protect natural resources and reduce the impacts of climate change on a global scale. \\nSustainability efforts in global value chains are often voluntary steps taken in the private sector, such as the use of sustainability standards and certifications, and ecolabels, but they can sometimes lack evidence of measurable sustainable impacts. For example, some ecolabels seek to address issues such as poverty. Yet in some cases, even if producers meet ecolabel standards, the burden of certification costs can end up reducing the overall income for these producers.  \\nThe measurement of sustainability in global value chains requires a multifaceted assessment which includes environmental, social and economic impacts, and it must also be standardized enough to be compared in order to generate sufficient learning and for scalability. Technologies that make these types of measurements are becoming both more available and essential for the public and private sector sustainability efforts. Besides, the recent finding shows that the local realities like governance system and institutions also play a significant role in economic sustainability of the global value chains. Implementation of sustainability policies at the global level demands the greening of supply chains in their entirety, as well as their comprehensive technological modernization to accommodate advancing trends such as digitization, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data.\\n\\n\\n== Negative impacts of global value chains ==\\nGlobal supply chain management is facing the increasing difficulty in predicting demand variability in different areas. In addition, managing the production and transportation of goods over large distances to meet the peak demand represents another challenge.\\nIntegrating global value chains requires all actors to adapt to technological changes, which is capital-intensive. Therefore, it is safe to say that this trend significantly benefits developed countries rather than developing countries.\\nShifting of production base by the lead firm raises the challenges of sustainability for the local firms (economy) and the labor (society).\\n\\n\\n== Data and Software ==\\nOECD maintains Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables, the most recent update was November 2021. An earlier project started at the University of Groningen. GTAP maintains a software program with an included trade database. Open-source software in R includes the decompr and gvc packages.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nAgricultural value chain\\nGlobal commodity chain\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nGlobal Value Chain Data Visualization',\n",
       " 'A value chain is a progression of activities that a business or firm performs in order to deliver goods and services of value to an end customer. The concept comes from the field of business management and was first described  by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.\\n\\nThe idea of [Porter\\'s Value Chain] is based on the process view of organizations, the idea of seeing a manufacturing (or service) organization as a system, made up of subsystems each with inputs, transformation processes and outputs. Inputs, transformation processes, and outputs involve the acquisition and consumption of resources – money, labour, materials, equipment, buildings, land, administration and management. How value chain activities are carried out determines costs and affects profits.\\nAccording to the OECD Secretary-General (Gurría 2012), the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises (Gurría 2012).\\n\\n\\n== Role of the business unit ==\\nAccording to Porter, the appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit within a business, not a business division or the company as a whole. Porter is concerned that analysis at the higher company levels may hide certain sources of competitive advantage only visible at the business unit level.\\n\\nProducts pass through a chain of activities in order, and at each activity the product gains some value. The chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities.\\n\\n\\n=== Primary activities ===\\nAll five primary activities are essential in adding value and creating a competitive advantage and they are:\\n\\nInbound logistics: arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, and/or finished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants, warehouses, or retail stores\\nOperations: concerned with managing the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services).\\nOutbound logistics: is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end user\\nMarketing and sales: selling products and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\\nService: includes all the activities required to keep the product working effectively for the buyer after it is sold and delivered.\\nCompanies can harness a competitive advantage at any one of the five activities in the value chain. For example, by creating outbound logistics that are highly efficient or by reducing a company\\'s shipping costs, it allows to either realize more profits or pass the savings to the consumer by way of lower prices.\\n\\n\\n=== Support activities ===\\n\\nUsing support activities helps make primary activities more effective. Increasing any of the four support activities helps at least one primary activity to work more efficiently.\\n\\nInfrastructure: consists of activities such as accounting, legal, finance, control, public relations, quality assurance and general (strategic) management.\\nTechnological development: pertains to the equipment, hardware, software, procedures and technical knowledge brought to bear in the firm\\'s transformation of inputs(Raw materials) into outputs (finished goods).\\nHuman resources management: consists of all activities involved in recruiting, hiring, training, developing, compensating and (if necessary) dismissing or laying off personnel.\\nProcurement: the acquisition of goods, services or works from an outside external source. In this field company also makes decisions of purchases.\\n\\n\\n=== Virtual value chain ===\\nThe virtual value chain, created by John Sviokla and Jeffrey Rayport, is a business model describing the dissemination of value-generating information services throughout an Extended Enterprise. This value chain begins with the content supplied by the provider, which is then distributed and supported by the information infrastructure; thereupon the context provider supplies actual customer interaction. It supports the physical value chain of procurement, manufacturing, distribution and sales of traditional companies.\\n\\n\\n== Industry-level ==\\n\\nAn industry value-chain is a physical representation of the various processes involved in producing goods (and services), starting with raw materials and ending with the delivered product (also known as the supply chain). It is based on the notion of value-added at the link (read: stage of production) level. The sum total of link-level value-added yields total value. The French Physiocrats\\' Tableau économique is one of the earliest examples of a value chain. Wassily Leontief\\'s input-output tables, published in the 1950s, provide estimates of the relative importance of each individual link in industry-level value-chains for the U.S. economy.\\n\\n\\n== Global value chains ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cross border / cross region value chains ===\\nOften multinational enterprises (MNEs) developed global value chains, investing abroad and establishing affiliates that provided critical support to remaining activities at home.  To enhance efficiency and to optimize profits, multinational enterprises locate \"research, development, design, assembly, production of parts, marketing and branding\" activities in different countries around the globe. MNEs offshore labour-intensive activities to China and Mexico, for example, where the cost of labor is the lowest (Gurría 2012). The emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises.(Gurría 2012)\\n\\n\\n=== Global value chains in development ===\\nThrough global value chains, there has been a growth in interconnectedness as MNEs play an increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business. In response, governments have cut corporate income tax rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscape (LeBlanc, Matthews & Mellbye 2013, p. 6).\\nIn an (industrial) development context, the concepts of global value chain analysis were first introduced in the 1990s (Gereffi et al.) and have gradually been integrated into development policy by the World Bank, Unctad, the OECD and others.\\nValue chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain. Although commonly associated with export-oriented trade, development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intra-regional chains in addition to international ones.\\nFor example, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in India. Its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor, without sacrificing food and fodder security, while protecting the environment.\\n\\n\\n== Significance ==\\nThe value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning. The simpler concept of value stream mapping, a cross-functional process which was developed over the next decade, had some success in the early 1990s.\\nThe value-chain concept has been extended beyond individual firms. It can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks. The delivery of a mix of products (goods and services) to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors, each managing its own value chain. The industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain, sometimes global in extent. Porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the \"value system\". A value system includes the value chains of a firm\\'s supplier (and their suppliers all the way back), the firm itself, the firm distribution channels, and the firm\\'s buyers (and presumably extended to the buyers of their products, and so on).\\nCapturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists. For example, a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models, or in other ways create improvements in its value system.\\n\\n\\n== SCOR ==\\n\\nThe Supply-Chain Council, a global trade consortium in operation with over 700 member companies, governmental, academic, and consulting groups participating in the last 10 years, manages the Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), the de facto universal reference model for Supply Chain including Planning, Procurement, Manufacturing, Order Management, Logistics, Returns, and Retail; Product and Service Design including Design Planning, Research, Prototyping, Integration, Launch and Revision, and Sales including CRM, Service Support, Sales, and Contract Management which are congruent to the Porter framework. The SCOR framework has been adopted by hundreds of companies as well as national entities as a standard for business excellence, and the U.S. Department of Defense has adopted the newly launched Design-Chain Operations Reference (DCOR) framework for product design as a standard to use for managing their development processes. In addition to process elements, these reference frameworks also maintain a vast database of standard process metrics aligned to the Porter model, as well as a large and constantly researched database of prescriptive universal best practices for process execution.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nKaplinsky, Raphael; Morris, Mike (2001).
